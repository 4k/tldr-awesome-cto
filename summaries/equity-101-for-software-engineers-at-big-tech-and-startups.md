## Key Insights

**Equity Scale at Top Companies:**
- Staff+ engineers at Big Tech often receive more in stock annually than base salary
- Total comp packages >$250K US / €150K EU typically have significant equity components

**Successful Outcomes (Examples):**
- $12M gain: DoorDash SWE2 who joined 2018
- $10M gain: First 10 Amplitude engineers (4-year vest)
- $6M gain: Databricks engineer with 50K options (late 2018)
- €500K/year: Snap engineer in Europe due to 6x stock rise

**Critical Vesting Terms:**
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff (private cos), quarterly/monthly vesting
- Red flags: >4 year vesting, 90-day exercise windows, equity clawbacks
- Seek: 10-year post-termination exercise windows

**Options vs RSUs Trade-offs:**
- Options: Upside potential but require cash to exercise + taxes before liquidity
- RSUs (public cos): Immediate value, can sell after vesting
- Double-trigger RSUs (pre-IPO): No tax until liquidity event

**Tax Reality Check:**
- Secfi study: Taxes averaged 6x the exercise price at unicorns
- Early exercising can save 20%+ in taxes (Snowflake case study)
- Consider financing solutions (Secfi, EquityBee) for large option packages

**Dilution Impact:**
- 20x company growth ≠ 20x equity value due to dilution
- Typical outcome: 5-15x gains despite dilution from fundraising rounds

**Failure Modes:**
- WeWork: Employees lost hundreds of thousands in taxes on $50/share stock that became $4
- Good Technology: $1B→$425M fire sale left option holders with nothing
- FanDuel: $465M acquisition, employees got zero

## Bottom Line
Equity can generate life-changing wealth for engineers at top companies, but requires understanding vesting terms, tax implications, and substantial downside risk.
