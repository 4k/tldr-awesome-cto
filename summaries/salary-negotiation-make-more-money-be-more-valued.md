## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiations have massive lifetime impact**: A $5K increase compounds to ~$100K over 10 years through annual raises, 401k matching, and higher baseline for future roles

- **Companies view salaries differently than you**: Your $5K request is 3% of fully-loaded cost (~$20K/month for CA/NY engineers). HR sees "mouse droppings," you see life-changing money

- **Your hiring manager Bob isn't spending his own money**: He gets no meaningful reward for saving $5K but benefits from higher budgets and managing expensive talent

- **Never give a number first**: This is so critical that volunteering salary info signals "catastrophic incompetence" to hiring managers, like flunking FizzBuzz signals to engineers

- **Only negotiate after "Yes-If"**: Must have agreement-in-principle from hiring authority before discussing compensation. Never negotiate from "No-But"

- **Standard objections to dodge**: 
  - "Need a number to move forward" → "Let's focus on mutual fit first"
  - "Form requires number" → "Put $1, we'll circle back"
  - "Need to check if you're appropriate" → Redirect to your qualifications

- **Use their language back**: Mirror key phrases from job descriptions ("scaling traffic," "fast-moving environment"). Take notes during interviews to capture their specific concerns and words

- **Research compensation levers**: Some companies push back on salary but give stock options easily. Learn what's negotiable before you negotiate

- **Multi-dimensional trading**: Don't fixate on salary alone. Trade vacation days, professional development, work arrangements for salary concessions. Say offers are "interesting" (positive but non-committal)

- **Have an external authority**: "I'll need to discuss with family" creates legitimate delay and negotiating room

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation is a 5-minute conversation that determines 10+ years of lifetime earnings, yet engineers systematically under-negotiate due to viewing it as morally questionable rather than standard business practice.
