## Key Insights

- **Replace phone screens with 3-hour take-home**: Single function coding question + data structure problem + short design doc (all based on real problems you've solved)
- **Anonymous grading eliminates bias**: Submissions go into code review tool, graded blind by different engineer using standardized rubric
- **Take-home performance strongly correlates with onsite performance** vs. phone screens which were "much more variable"
- **Onsite becomes code review discussion**: Candidate walks through their existing code on laptop, interviewer picks interesting parts to dive deeper - no live coding pressure
- **Eliminate low-signal elements**: Tests provided "basically no extra signal" and added time, so removed them entirely
- **Add scaffolding to save candidate time**: Pre-built framework reduces grunt work, makes auto-testing easier
- **Mention obvious/poor solutions upfront**: Since you can't course-correct live, explicitly call out naive approaches to avoid
- **Early bug-hunting format failed**: Having candidates find their own bugs was harder to conduct and less consistent than code review style

## Key Framework
1. Take-home (3 hours): 2 coding questions + design doc
2. Anonymous grading with rubric 
3. Onsite: collaborative code review of their work
4. Follow-up coding only for junior candidates

## Bottom Line
Take-home exercises based on real problems, graded anonymously, then discussed collaboratively onsite produces more accurate hiring signals than traditional phone screens and whiteboard coding.
