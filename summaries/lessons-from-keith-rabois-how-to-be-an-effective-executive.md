## Key Insights

**Personal Effectiveness:**
- Output = (your team's output + neighboring teams' output) / team size. Only hire if they raise this ratio
- Judge team on inputs (quality of thinking) not outputs (revenue targets) to encourage high-upside experiments vs. safe projects
- Spend 80% of time on top 3 weekly priorities. Do calendar audits monthly, categorizing time spent
- Focus on limiting step (bottleneck) - dedicate 20-80% of time to the single constraint blocking progress
- Batch similar tasks to reduce context switching costs

**Information Gathering:**
- CEOs judged on ~4 critical decisions per year. Spend most time gathering unfiltered information
- Walk around office, do skip-level meetings to bypass filtering layers
- Use weekly written reports to force clarity of thinking (benefits writer more than reader)

**Team Management:**
- Pair all metrics to prevent gaming (e.g., fraud loss rate + false positive rate)
- Simplify to ONE objective - each logical step loses 20-40% team performance
- Four meeting types: 1:1s (junior sets agenda), staff meetings (affects 2+ people), decision meetings, operational reviews
- Make decisions by knowledge not position when possible. Push decisions to lowest competent level

**Performance Framework:**
- Motivation vs. capability: If they could do it "if life depended on it" = motivation problem (your fault). If not = capability mismatch
- Task-relevant maturity determines management style: low experience = micromanage, high experience = hands-off
- Extend rope when downside is low, conviction is low. Always expand scope until people hit breaking point, then pull back

## Bottom Line
Maximize leverage by focusing on inputs over outputs, spending 80% of time on top priorities, and pushing decisions to the lowest competent level while extending team members' scope until they break.
