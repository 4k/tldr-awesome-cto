## Key Insights

**Product Management Framework: 4 Core Dimensions**
- Vision, Strategy, Design, Execution - each requires specific deliverables vs just activities
- Vision narrative (1-2 pages prose) beats vision statements - provides context, storyline, and inspiration
- Strategy = 6 product/market fit hypotheses: Problem, Target audience, Value prop, Competitive advantage, Growth strategy, Business model

**Customer Discovery**
- Scott Cook rule: "When surprised, either upside or downside, the market is telling you something you don't know"
- Quality/quantity of surprise insights = what PMs optimize for in discovery
- PM owns insight synthesis and roadmap incorporation regardless of research resources

**Roadmap Prioritization: 4 Lenses Framework**
- Vision lens: investments toward future state
- Strategy lens: gaps between stated strategy and current product
- Customer lens: highest impact to most important user segments  
- Business lens: acquisition/engagement/monetization metric improvements
- Art = thoughtfully combining conflicting priorities from all 4 lenses

**Essential Dashboards**
- Minimum 3 dashboards: Acquisition, Engagement, Monetization
- Review daily/weekly to build intuition for natural metric fluctuations
- Mobile-accessible for constant monitoring

**Decision Communication**
- Share rationale, not just decisions - builds trust and enables future reversals
- Document rationales when possible (Square uses notes@square.com for broad distribution)
- Rationale sharing drives clarity of thought in decision-making process

**OKRs as Leadership Tool**
- Drives focus, alignment, accountability, outcome orientation
- Critical for resource allocation communication with senior leadership

## Bottom Line
Product management success requires treating each dimension (vision, strategy, design, execution) as concrete deliverables with specific frameworks rather than just performing associated activities.
