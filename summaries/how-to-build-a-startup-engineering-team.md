## Key Insights

**Founder Alignment**
- Establish role division before starting: CTO owns technical vision/architecture, VPE owns people/process/delivery
- Push back lightly when founders overstep, maintain clear signals to team about who handles what
- Create leverage by handling GitHub issues, build systems, recruiting, status updates while CTO focuses on prototypes/demos/tech exploration

**Team Structure**
- Minimum team size: 3 people (excluding manager), maximum: 10 people, ideal: 7-8
- Optimal composition: 1 staff engineer, 3 senior engineers, 4 engineers + 1 manager
- Build career ladder early as recruitment tool, not just management artifact
- Start simple: Engineer → Senior → Staff → Principal; EM → Senior EM → Director

**Release Strategy**
- Separate builds (continuous) from releases (scheduled)
- Internal releases: every 2 weeks for acceptance testing/risk reduction
- External releases: monthly for SaaS, quarterly for enterprise
- Use feature toggles for selective rollout
- Tailor cadence to customer consumption ability (enterprise needs slower releases due to compliance/security friction)

**Process Framework**
- "Use a process. Not too much. Mostly agile."
- Start minimal Kanban: To Do → Prioritized → In Progress → Blocked → Done
- Avoid naming methodologies directly to prevent dogma
- Regular retrospectives to modify frameworks, not treat them as rules

**Communication Rituals**
- Product reviews: demonstrate features to whole org, get stakeholder feedback, boost morale through visible progress
- Engineering reviews: technical deep-dives for engineers only, drive high-bandwidth communication across teams

## Bottom Line
Build startup engineering teams through clear founder role separation, small cross-functional teams (3-10 people), minimal but consistent process, and regular demo cycles that make progress visible to the entire organization.
