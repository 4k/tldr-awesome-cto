## Key Insights

**Manager README Framework (based on 12 top tech company examples):**

**Core sections all include:**
- Document purpose/context explanation
- About Me/My Job - role clarity and personal context
- Personal Principles/Values - default assumptions, mindsets, triggers
- One-on-Ones style - Most use weekly/bi-weekly 30min, employee controls agenda
- Feedback preferences - how to give/receive, comfort with directness
- Calendar interpretation - explicit availability promises despite packed schedules

**Optional but valuable sections:**
- Personal performance scales - Most use Red/Orange/Green system
- D.R.I. (Directly Responsible Individual) expectations
- Response time expectations by communication channel
- Work-life balance boundaries

**Specific practices from examples:**
- Scott (Stratasan): "Managers work for their direct reports" + "Inbox maintenance isn't what you're paid for"
- Matt (Etsy): Guests can edit calendar events by default + People > Process
- Elliott (RentTheRunway): Treats document as "promise" and asks to be held accountable
- Multiple managers: Include personal quirks/weaknesses they're working on

**Implementation best practices:**
- Deliver via 1:1 walkthrough (most effective method)
- Best timing: during employee or manager onboarding
- Consider hosting on GitHub for transparent version control

## Bottom Line

Manager READMEs create explicit working agreements that prevent misunderstandings and accelerate team relationships by documenting communication preferences, feedback styles, and management philosophy upfront.
