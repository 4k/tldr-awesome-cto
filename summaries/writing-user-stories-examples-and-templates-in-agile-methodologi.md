## Key Insights

**User Story Definition & Scope**
- User story = unit of work completable in one sprint (ideally ≤1 week)
- Keep stories in flat list structure; avoid nested hierarchies (harder to model on whiteboards)
- Epic = work requiring multiple sprints; Theme = collection of epics

**User Story Template**
- Format: "As a [type of user], I want [goal], so that [benefit/value]"
- Template forces three critical questions: Who (user), What (intention), Why (value)
- Bad example: "As a user, I am able to provide best support service to my customer" (too vague)

**Story Points & Estimation**
- Use Fibonacci numbers for relative complexity measurement
- Points don't equal time/effort, just relative sizing comparison
- Takes 5-10 sprints to master reliable estimation
- Team velocity should slowly increase over time

**INVEST Criteria for Quality Stories**
- Independent: Story stands alone
- Negotiable: Can be changed without breaking dependencies  
- Valuable: Provides end-user value
- Estimable: Size can be determined
- Small: Fits in one sprint
- Testable: Can be verified/tested

**Grooming Sessions**
- Run every 2 weeks during mid-sprint
- Timebox to 1 hour maximum
- Include senior technical members + business stakeholders
- Prioritize backlog beforehand; finalize acceptance criteria

**Story Characteristics**
- Must be user-centric (not system/component-focused)
- Should deliver standalone value when complete
- Group related stories into epics for better organization

## Bottom Line
Effective user stories require the INVEST framework, clear value articulation through the three-part template, and regular grooming sessions to maintain quality and team alignment.
