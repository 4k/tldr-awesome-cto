## Key Insights

**Roadmap Definition:**
- Roadmap = strategic document, NOT a work plan or feature list
- Functions as navigation guide, communication tool, and alignment mechanism
- For startups: limit to one goal maximum to maintain focus

**6 Essential Components:**

1. **Goal** - Business outcome you're trying to achieve
   - Examples: increase POC→contract conversion, get 5 enterprise logos, reduce churn
   - Must answer: What business results enable next funding round? What prevents achieving this today?

2. **Reasoning** - Detailed explanation of why these goals are correct
   - Use full explanations, not bullet points
   - Creates opportunity for strategic alignment discussion before implementation

3. **Route** - Large milestones with clear logical progression
   - Example sequence: Support ideal customer → Scale identical use cases → Expand to adjacent use cases → Target new segments
   - Each milestone must connect logically to the next

4. **ETA** - Quarterly-level time estimates, not day-accurate timelines
   - Purpose: assess if route is feasible before "trains leave station" (funding runs out, competitors win, market shifts)

5. **Risks & Mitigation** - Worst-case scenarios with prepared responses
   - Add measurements and checkpoints to monitor risk levels

6. **What You Won't Do** - Explicit exclusions to maintain focus
   - Evaluate all product requests against chosen route
   - Requires courage to say no to customer/executive requests

**Process Rules:**
- Don't mix multiple goal routes until each is individually validated and logical
- Route must be "plausible on paper" before real-world validation

## Bottom Line
A strategic roadmap is a business navigation tool with clear goals, reasoning, and deliberate exclusions - not a feature wish list with dates.
