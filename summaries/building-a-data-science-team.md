## Key Insights
- Start with 3 separate teams: data science (ML algorithms), data engineering (pipelines/scale), and operations (infrastructure)
- **Hire data engineer first, not data scientist** - engineers build necessary infrastructure; data scientists from academia lack programming/engineering skills
- Data scientists hired without proper infrastructure quit within 6 months due to lack of data access
- Data science teams need high organizational placement (report to CTO/CEO/CDO) to get cross-departmental cooperation
- Don't impose software development practices on data science - it's experimental research, not predictable task completion
- Avoid KPI-based bonuses tied to model accuracy - creates wrong incentives
- Multiple competing data science teams in same organization leads to turf wars
- Business domain expertise bottlenecks (e.g., medical professionals for labeling) require management leverage to access
- Data science projects need direct communication lines to business stakeholders, not filtered through intermediaries
- Academic credentials (PhD, Ivy League) less important than STEM background + practical skills
- Common failure: treating data science as extension of software development with strict deadlines

## Bottom Line
Build data infrastructure first with engineers, place the team high in org structure for political leverage, and manage it like experimental research rather than traditional software development.
