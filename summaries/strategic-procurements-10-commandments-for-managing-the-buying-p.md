## Key Insights
- Procurement departments use 10 standardized rules to control hospital buying processes and reduce supplier leverage
- Rule #1: All supplier contact must go through procurement first - they control vendor identification and sourcing
- Clinical staff should discuss only functional specs, never pricing, budgets, timelines, or preferences with vendors
- Product trials require procurement approval - they set parameters (dates, locations, patient types, evaluation criteria)
- Never reveal: budget amounts, purchase timelines, product preferences, or competing vendors to suppliers
- Procurement leverages timing (supplier's month/quarter/year-end) and information asymmetry for better pricing
- Trade-ins must be evaluated by procurement who understand asset depreciation and market values
- Revealing preferences makes suppliers negotiate harder on price; keeping them guessing leads to better offers
- These tactics specifically designed to counter suppliers' information-gathering strategies during sales processes
- Medicare cuts and quality penalties drive hospitals to empower procurement for "dramatic and ruthless" cost cutting

## Bottom Line
Hospital procurement departments systematically control all vendor interactions through 10 rigid rules designed to maximize their negotiating leverage while minimizing supplier influence over clinical staff.
