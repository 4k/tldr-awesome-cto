## Key Insights
- **Geographic diversity beats talent density**: Current Discourse team spans globally vs. cramming everyone within 30-mile SF radius - broader talent pool, better diversity outcomes
- **Audition projects > interviews**: 3-8 week paid contract work (10-20 hours/week) reveals actual job performance better than any interview process
- **"Hire the best" creates systematic bias**: Zero-doubt hiring standards accidentally optimize for "People Like Us" - same backgrounds, similar thinking patterns
- **Measured bias impacts**: Baseball cards held by black hands sell 20% less; orchestra blind auditions increased women's advancement 50%; both police and civilians 3x more likely to "shoot" black men in rapid-fire scenarios
- **Rejection costs are overstated**: Twitter evidence shows companies routinely wrong about passed-over candidates (Chris Wanstrath rejected by Yahoo before GitHub; Trek Glowacki tracking proves "almost always wrong")
- **Structure work for outsider onboarding**: If you can't successfully onboard a potential hire on small project, your new hire onboarding probably sucks too
- **Pay candidates for intensive evaluation**: Multi-day interview processes extract free labor; audition projects compensate fairly for real work
- **Most startups fail regardless of talent**: Statistical reality means "hire crazy risk junkies" might be more practical than "hire the best"

## Bottom Line
Replace traditional hiring gatekeeping with paid audition projects and geographic diversity to avoid systematic bias while actually evaluating job performance.
