## Key Insights

**6-Week Cycle Structure:**
- Work in 6-week cycles with 2-week cooldowns
- No extensions - ship or kill at cycle end
- Cooldown for bug fixes, exploration, small improvements

**Shaping (Pre-Work):**
- Define problem boundaries before development starts
- Set "appetite" (time budget) before solution design
- Create rough wireframes/breadboards, not detailed specs
- Identify specific risks and rabbit holes upfront
- Write formal pitches with problem, appetite, solution, risks

**Betting Process:**
- Senior stakeholders meet every 6 weeks to choose what to build
- No backlog grooming - bets expire if not chosen
- Circuit breaker: kill projects that don't ship in one cycle
- Small teams (1 designer + 1-2 developers) own entire features

**Building Phase:**
- Teams have full autonomy within shaped boundaries  
- Work on one meaningful piece end-to-end first
- Map work into "scopes" (integrated slices of the system)
- Show progress through completed scopes, not tasks/points
- Default to cutting scope when timeline pressure hits

**Key Frameworks:**
- Fat Marker Sketches: Rough concept drawings that prevent over-specification
- Breadboarding: Three elements only - places, affordances, connection lines
- Circuit Breakers: Automatic project termination prevents runaway work

## Bottom Line
Replace continuous backlogs and sprints with deliberate 6-week betting cycles where senior leaders shape work upfront and small teams ship complete features with full autonomy.
