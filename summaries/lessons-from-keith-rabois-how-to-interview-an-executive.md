## Key Insights

**Value Creation vs Value Protection Framework:**
- Pre-Series B: hire ambitious risk-takers for value creation roles; accept some hiring mistakes
- Post-Series B: hire experienced, conservative operators for value protection (finance, legal, ops)
- Exception: regulatory-heavy companies may need protective roles early (Stripe hired GC as 10th employee)

**Owner Mentality Test:**
- Ask: "What would you have done differently at your last company if you had been CEO?"
- Good answers: substantive, well-thought strategies they've obsessed over
- Red flags: "CEO did everything right" or blaming specific teams vs owning with "I/we"

**Strategic Thinking Assessment:**
- Have them ask questions about your business equation and key levers
- Strong candidates probe like investors, uncover new levers you hadn't considered
- Weak candidates ask generic questions applicable to any business

**Risk-Strength Alignment:**
- Map company's existential risks against current team's strengths
- Hire for biggest gaps in highest-risk areas
- Ask candidates: "What are your strengths/weaknesses vs similar backgrounds?"

**Talent Magnet Evaluation:**
- Spend 15-20 hours with candidates on real work (90-day plans, memos, board deck analysis)
- They should have 5+ people ready to recruit immediately
- Reference calls with former directs: did they bring/retain/develop their team?
- Senior executives' primary function is building excellent teams

## Bottom Line

Executive hiring success depends on matching role type (value creation vs protection) to candidate profile, then rigorously testing for ownership mentality, strategic thinking, risk-strength fit, and team-building ability through extended real work sessions.
