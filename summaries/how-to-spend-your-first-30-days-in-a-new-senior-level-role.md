## Key Insights

**First 30 Days Framework: "Sponge Mode"**
- Listen-only mode for entire first month - no changes except health/safety emergencies
- Schedule one-off 30-minute one-on-ones with all team members, cross-functional peers, and stakeholders
- Use this exact two-question framework in each one-on-one:
  1. "What change do you want to see in [department]?"
  2. "What's working so well that we shouldn't change?"
- Follow up with: "What's the risk if we don't make that change?" and "Who else should I chat with about this?"

**End of Month 30 Process**
- Synthesize feedback into 1-2 overarching themes from all conversations
- Present findings to entire organization in all-hands meeting format
- Use future-focused language: "team cohesion is the #1 most-requested focus" 
- Avoid specific past event examples to prevent "amygdala-hijacking"
- Goal is demonstrating listening skills, not announcing changes

**Trust-Building Rules**
- Making any change in first 30 days jeopardizes trust and standing, regardless of good intentions
- People want to see you're a good listener before accepting your leadership
- Be specific about ongoing communication cadence and follow through religiously
- Reschedule meetings or broken commitments immediately erode trust

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- Proving impact too quickly through process changes
- Using specific examples when presenting themes (creates disagreement)
- Committing to communication patterns you can't sustain

## Bottom Line
Senior leaders must spend their first 30 days exclusively listening and relationship-building before making any changes, as early action—however well-intentioned—destroys the trust foundation needed for future effectiveness.
