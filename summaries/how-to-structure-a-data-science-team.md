## Key Insights

**Team Structure Models (by complexity/coordination level):**
- **Decentralized**: Analytics scattered across units - cheapest but creates silos, hiring/career path issues
- **Functional**: Analytics in one dept (marketing/supply) - good for analytics beginners, risks isolation
- **Consulting**: Central DS team serves all depts - works for SMBs with sporadic needs, poor data quality risk
- **Centralized**: One DS team serves whole org strategically - enables long-term projects but may disconnect from business
- **Center of Excellence (CoE)**: Central coordination + distributed analysts - most balanced for enterprises
- **Federated**: CoE + elite SWAT team for complex cross-functional tasks - handles both daily needs and innovation
- **Democratic**: Everyone gets BI tool access - can combine with any model above

**Key Role Distinctions:**
- **Type A (Analysis)**: Statisticians doing cleaning/forecasting/modeling - weak programming
- **Type B (Building)**: Engineers building production systems - strong programming + some stats
- **Salary benchmark**: US median $112,774 (2017)

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Start with MLaaS platforms (Google/Amazon/Microsoft/IBM) for "low hanging fruit"
- Hire STEM generalists initially, then specialists later
- Look for internal talent before external hiring
- One person can fulfill multiple roles in smaller teams

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Cultural shift to horizontal decision-making is hardest part
- Product managers need technical knowledge of DS vs software differences
- Embed data scientists in business units while reporting centrally
- Foster cross-functional collaboration from day one

## Bottom Line
Start with MLaaS and generalists, then evolve toward federated/CoE models as you scale, but the cultural shift to data-driven decision making is more critical than team structure.
