**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

- CTO role is primarily communication and leadership, not coding - protect tech team from becoming "pure execution arm" for others' ideas
- Must have absolute authority over technical decisions - if you need to "sell" unit testing to the board, you're not a CTO but a lead engineer in a suit
- Business knowledge is #1 requirement - all technical decisions must align with business needs and customer value, not exist in isolation
- Apply 80-20 rule to technology investments - find solutions delivering 80% return with 20% cost
- Avoid the rewrite trap - legacy systems become expensive but rewrites "almost always deliver zero value to the customer"
- Focus on reliability and security as top priorities when evaluating business changes
- Create welcoming environment for developers (approve TDD, pair programming, staging servers as needed) since hiring is the biggest challenge
- Technology should be invisible to users - debates about specific languages/frameworks are irrelevant to organizational success
- Balance advancing infrastructure with maintaining existing systems - building teams that only want newest tech is unsustainable
- Role requires comfort with meetings, non-technical stakeholders, and business strategy discussions

## Bottom Line
A CTO's job is defining technology vision and strategy while protecting the dev team's autonomy, not writing code or debating which programming languages are better.

# #define CTO

**Source:** https://blog.gregbrockman.com/figuring-out-the-cto-role-at-stripe
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**CTO Role Evolution:**
- CTO roles aren't standardized - only 1 of 20 CTOs surveyed was chief architect; most are "facilitators of the technology organization"
- Being part-time chief architect is harder than part-time head of product because infrastructure quality only emerges through extensive building
- Four mechanisms to understand organizational problems: doing work, talking to people, observing work, planning work

**VP Engineering Partnership:**
- When hiring VP Eng externally, had all 25 engineers do 1:1s with candidate over 4 days to test for core skill needed
- Two delegation approaches work: complete delegation or full involvement in details - "sparse micromanagement" is worst option
- Communication pattern: 2 weekly 1:1s plus "I plan to do X; will execute in 24hrs unless objected"

**Organizational Scaling:**
- At Dunbar's number (~150 people), shift from "close friends" to formal processes required
- Feedback loops break when transitioning responsibilities - anecdotes become outdated quickly
- Energy management > time management for executives

**Technical Leadership Structure:**
- Created "architecture working group" - engineers available to help others build better systems
- Prototype-and-dump doesn't work; partnering with team engineers on prototypes is better
- Getting back to coding provides better organizational perspective than pure management

## Bottom Line
CTOs should focus on energy management over time management, maintain tight communication loops with VP Engineering partners, and find ways to stay connected to actual work rather than purely managing.

# Evolution of my role as a founder CTO

**Source:** https://miguelcarranza.es/cto
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**CTO Role Evolution Framework:**
- 2-4 engineers: Individual contributor focused on architecture and MVP
- 8-12 engineers: Critical breaking point where management processes become essential
- 18+ engineers: Full delegation required, focus shifts to organizational scaling

**CTO vs VP Engineering Decision:**
- CTO path: Technical architecture, domain expertise, direct code influence
- VP Engineering path: Process management, team scaling, organizational structure
- Founder advantage: Early employees more forgiving of management inexperience

**Key Transition Milestones:**
- Stop coding completely when you become the bottleneck for feature delivery
- Breaking points accelerate with distributed teams/multiple time zones
- On-call rotation should be implemented immediately after product-market fit

**Specific Scaling Data (RevenueCat):**
- 2018: 2 engineers, 1 time zone
- 2019: 4 engineers, 3 time zones  
- 2020: 8 engineers, 6 time zones
- 2021: 18 engineers, distributed globally

**Management Evolution:**
- Year 1: No formal process, weekly sprints
- Year 2: Monthly 1:1s, basic monitoring, founder on-call 24/7
- Year 3: Regular 1:1s, formal delegation, recruiting focus
- Year 4: Full organizational design, diversity hiring, junior engineer development

**Critical Realizations:**
- Founder dopamine should come from company success, not personal coding achievements
- Technical debt is beneficial during product-market fit phase
- Reducing bus factor more important than individual productivity
- Referral hiring works early but limits diversity at scale

## Bottom Line

Founder CTOs must transition from individual contributor to organizational architect around 8-12 engineers, prioritizing company needs over personal technical preferences while leveraging founder credibility to experiment with inexperienced management.

# How my role as CTO has changed as we've grown to 100 engineers

**Source:** https://medium.com/gusto-engineering/how-my-role-as-cto-has-changed-as-weve-grown-to-100-engineers-b16a8a6b1a88
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**Role Evolution by Team Size:**
- 1 engineer: 90% coding, living in $300/month closet, building MVP
- 2-10 engineers: 60% coding, 30-40% recruiting (this recruiting ratio stays constant throughout all stages)
- 11-50 engineers: Started clinging to coding while trying to manage - failed spectacularly
- 51-100 engineers: 60% people management, 40% recruiting, zero coding except hackathons

**The Binary Choice at ~50 Engineers:**
- Technical co-founders must choose: stay technical and hire VP Engineering, OR give up coding entirely for management
- Attempting both simultaneously causes team instability and personal burnout
- Author's failed NYC trip: planned 3 days reading management books, spent entire time coding instead

**Management Transition Framework:**
- Replace technical books with: Mindset, High Output Management, The Score Takes Care of Itself
- Shift focus from "growing code" to "growing engineering team"
- Satisfaction source changes from personal coding output to team impact over longer time horizons

**Specific Management Activities (51-100 stage):**
- Engineering onboarding improvement
- Performance management systems
- Diversity and inclusion initiatives
- Technical debt balancing processes
- Cross-office code ownership negotiations

**Scale Benchmarks:**
- 60,000 customers, 600 employees, 100 engineers, $1B+ valuation after 6 years

## Bottom Line
CTOs must completely abandon coding around 50 engineers to focus exclusively on people management and recruiting, or risk team instability from trying to do both roles poorly.

# How to spend your first 30 days in a new senior-level role

**Source:** https://larahogan.me/blog/first-30-days-new-role/
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**First 30 Days Framework: "Sponge Mode"**
- Listen-only mode for entire first month - no changes except health/safety emergencies
- Schedule one-off 30-minute one-on-ones with all team members, cross-functional peers, and stakeholders
- Use this exact two-question framework in each one-on-one:
  1. "What change do you want to see in [department]?"
  2. "What's working so well that we shouldn't change?"
- Follow up with: "What's the risk if we don't make that change?" and "Who else should I chat with about this?"

**End of Month 30 Process**
- Synthesize feedback into 1-2 overarching themes from all conversations
- Present findings to entire organization in all-hands meeting format
- Use future-focused language: "team cohesion is the #1 most-requested focus" 
- Avoid specific past event examples to prevent "amygdala-hijacking"
- Goal is demonstrating listening skills, not announcing changes

**Trust-Building Rules**
- Making any change in first 30 days jeopardizes trust and standing, regardless of good intentions
- People want to see you're a good listener before accepting your leadership
- Be specific about ongoing communication cadence and follow through religiously
- Reschedule meetings or broken commitments immediately erode trust

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- Proving impact too quickly through process changes
- Using specific examples when presenting themes (creates disagreement)
- Committing to communication patterns you can't sustain

## Bottom Line
Senior leaders must spend their first 30 days exclusively listening and relationship-building before making any changes, as early action—however well-intentioned—destroys the trust foundation needed for future effectiveness.

# The Different CTO Roles

**Source:** https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/07/the_different_cto_roles.html
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights
- Four distinct CTO models based on scope and focus:
  - **Infrastructure Manager**: Handles data centers, networks, security when CIO role becomes too complex (traditional businesses)
  - **Technology Visionary + Operations Manager**: Determines tech strategy AND runs operations (dot-coms, tech companies, often co-founders)
  - **External Facing Technologist**: Bridge between customers and internal dev, drives product portfolio (software/middleware companies)
  - **Big Thinker**: Evaluates tech for new business models, competitive analysis, disruption prevention

- Management span varies dramatically by model:
  - Models 1-2: Direct management of 500-1000+ engineers
  - Models 3-4: Small teams of 10-50 engineers functioning as tech incubators

- Influence structure differs:
  - First two models: Influence through direct engineering org control
  - Last two models: Must influence across divisions, typically report to CEO

- Role emerged in late 1980s when R&D lab directors moved to strategic positions to capitalize on lab results

- No universal CTO definition exists - role depends entirely on company type and technology's strategic importance

## Bottom Line
The CTO role has four distinct patterns based on whether you manage large engineering teams directly or influence strategy across the organization with smaller incubation teams.

# Three Golden Rules to Finding a CTO

**Source:** https://www.rudebaguette.com/2011/12/01/three-golden-rules-to-finding-a-cto/
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**The Three Golden Rules:**

**Rule #1: Only CTOs can hire developers**
- Non-technical founders lack the expertise to evaluate technical talent or organize dev teams
- If you can assess technical skills, you ARE the CTO

**Rule #2: Don't sell the job, sell the adventure**
- CTOs join for disruption and challenge, not coding tasks
- Pitch creative control and decision-making authority, not feature lists
- Address objections upfront (no salary → show investor connections for future funding)
- Stay vague on technical specs - let candidates propose their approach

**Rule #3: Hire 3 years ago, not today**
- Founding teams need time to build working relationships before crises hit
- If hiring now is unavoidable, focus on cultural fit over pure technical skills

**Sourcing strategies:**
- **Startup Weekend**: Go to meet developers, not start companies
- **Geographic diversity**: Travel to events in other cities/countries to avoid local talent competition  
- **Strategic poaching**: Target developers at struggling startups in your space - they have domain knowledge and may be ready to jump

**Effective CTO pitch example breakdown:**
- Lead with personality/culture fit ("RUDE CTO")
- Emphasize disruption opportunity 
- Show flexibility on technical choices
- Address compensation honestly with upside potential
- Require writing skills for communication

## Bottom Line

Stop posting generic developer job descriptions and instead sell the founding opportunity, strategic influence, and adventure to someone who can actually build your technical team.

# VP Engineering vs CTO

**Source:** https://avc.com/2011/10/vp-engineering-vs-cto/
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**Role Definitions:**
- VP Engineering: Manager/team builder focused on recruiting, communication, issue resolution. Makes engineering team successful day-to-day
- CTO: Strongest technologist - architect, researcher, tester. Ensures technical approach is correct
- Key dynamic: "CTO makes sure technical approach is correct, VP Engineering makes sure the team is correct. They are yin and yang"

**Organizational Evolution:**
- Early stage: Technical co-founder wears both hats
- Split typically happens around 20 people
- Most technical co-founders migrate to CTO role, then hire VP Engineering
- Reverse (co-founder becomes VP Eng, hires CTO) less common but works

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Requires different personality traits that rarely coexist in one person
- Different time allocations - both are full-time jobs
- Must have mutual trust, respect, and liking between roles
- CTO often plays key role in strategic customer wins and sales assists

**Failure Modes:**
- Person trying to do both roles: ineffective at both, defaults to VP Eng, or consciously chooses VP Eng
- Early stage companies make more progress with VP Eng than CTO alone
- CTOs without VP Eng spend too much time designing perfection vs. shipping first version

**Additional CTO Responsibilities:**
- Customer-facing presentations to C-suite prospects
- Product roadmap collaboration (2-5 year vision)
- Technical sales support for large deals

## Bottom Line
Most companies need both roles by 20 people, with CTO focused on technical vision/architecture and VP Engineering on team execution - finding someone who excels at both is extremely rare.

# Year 4 Update

**Source:** https://miguelcarranza.es/cto-year-4
**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**Scaling Metrics (2021 actual vs planned):**
- Engineering team: 17 (+112% vs planned ~18)
- Company size: 40 (+136% vs planned ~45)
- Geographic distribution doubled: 28 cities, 10 countries, 7 time zones

**Critical Delegation Framework:**
- Ask constantly: "What should I be doing now not to have to work again?"
- Hiring Executive Assistant was transformational for calendar/email control
- Founder bottleneck after 4 years = major red flag

**Hiring Realities:**
- VPE search: 6 months, 40+ candidates, extremely draining but non-delegable
- SRE/Engineering Manager roles take significantly longer than expected
- Market timing underestimation caused organizational strain
- MOC (mission-outcomes-competencies) document essential for executive alignment

**Executive Search Lessons:**
- Distinguish between "war-time" VPEs (rebuild dysfunctional teams) vs growth VPEs (scale existing culture)
- Executive search firms worth the cost for candidate exposure
- Need someone to complement, not replace, technical founder strengths

**Operational Infrastructure:**
- API serving 600M+ requests/day
- SOC 2 compliance required for enterprise deals
- Reliability squad creation was overdue

**Personal Sustainability:**
- Geographic relocation dramatically improved mental health and team performance
- Burnout prevention: watch for signs, establish boundaries, take real vacations
- Working longer hours as coping mechanism is dangerous

**2022 Focus Areas:**
- Double team again to ~34 engineers
- Deterministic onboarding for 100+ engineer scale
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure investment

## Bottom Line
Scaling from 8 to 17 engineers requires ruthless delegation and executive hiring, with founder burnout being the biggest risk to continued growth.

- Made Zendesk the unified OS for support tickets to eliminate context switching

**CTO Role Evolution:**
- Replaced weekly 1:1s with open office hours for entire company
- Shifted from leading technical projects to technical consultant role
- Took support engineering under CTO (technical team reporting to technical leader)
- Support team split into "self-serve" vs "sold" tracks

**Support Engineering Fixes:**
- Unified all ticket sources into Zendesk
- Made support more technical with iOS dev sessions and pair programming
- Data-driven approach to reduce common tickets through better docs/product/tools
- Quickly improved morale and response times

**2023 Strategy - "Year of Shipping":**
- New GTM engineering team for same-day customer implementations
- Focus on product improvements for larger accounts
- More selective hiring with limited headcount budget

**Key Learnings:**
- First vested employees stayed (growth mindset > early-stage nostalgia)
- Office hours recovered calendar time but requires proactive scheduling for key people
- Founders must stay connected to users through sales/support/interviews
- Founder workload never disappears - institutional knowledge sharing is irreplaceable

## Bottom Line
Mature processes and strong team structure enabled the founder CTO to shift from operational bottleneck to strategic technical consultant while maintaining customer connection through support engineering ownership.

# Hiring

# Getting the Interview Phone Screen Right

**Source:** https://blog.codinghorror.com/getting-the-interview-phone-screen-right/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Phone Screen Structure:**
- Interviewer should drive conversation, not candidate - avoid letting them ramble about past work
- Push candidates out of comfort zone with unfamiliar problems to test adaptability
- Look for "total vacuum" in knowledge areas, not minor struggles or rustiness
- One failed phone screen saves 8+ man-hours wasted on unqualified face-to-face interviews

**Five Essential Areas to Test:**

**Coding:** Simple syntax verification
- Examples: reverse string, Nth Fibonacci, print odd numbers 1-99, find largest int in array
- 25-35% of candidates fail basic problems like FizzBuzz

**OO Design:** Basic principles understanding
- Examples: design deck of cards, model animal kingdom, represent filesystem
- Test familiarity with OO concepts, not comprehensive design

**Scripting/Regex:** Tool selection over reinvention
- Standard test: Find phone numbers in 50,000 HTML files in 2 days
- 25-35% cannot solve even with hints - indicates whether developer will waste days on automatable tasks

**Data Structures:** Core CS fundamentals
- Must know arrays, vectors, linked lists, hashtables, trees, graphs
- Understand Big-O complexity: constant, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, exponential, factorial

**Bits/Bytes:** Low-level programming basics
- Test high-order bit detection, bit counting, palindrome bit patterns
- Should know 2^16, AND/OR/XOR operations, signed vs unsigned

**Red Flags:**
- One-trick ponies who only know single language/environment
- Candidates who can't explain why "Oct 31 = Dec 25" programmer joke is funny

## Bottom Line
A structured phone screen testing these five technical fundamentals eliminates most unqualified candidates before expensive on-site interviews, with each prevented interview saving 8+ man-hours.

# GitLab Talent Acquisition Framework

**Source:** https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights
- **Three-pillar hiring framework**: Experience (stakeholder-centric partnership), Inclusivity (equitable processes), Predictability (right people, right roles, right time)
- **Distributed-first approach**: Built for fully remote, global talent acquisition from day one
- **Role-specific playbooks**: Separate training/playbooks for recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, and candidate experience specialists
- **Predictability focus**: Emphasizes forecast accuracy and data-driven decision making to enable business planning
- **Stakeholder experience prioritization**: Positions TA as strategic partner/advisor rather than order-taker
- **Inclusivity integration**: Designs equity into processes rather than treating as add-on
- **Comprehensive resource library**: Covers full hiring lifecycle from referrals to internal mobility
- **Transparency with boundaries**: Open handbook approach but strategic content restricted to internal teams

## Bottom Line
GitLab's TA framework centers on three pillars (experience, inclusivity, predictability) with distributed-first processes and role-specific playbooks to enable strategic hiring partnerships rather than transactional recruiting.

# Hitting the High Notes

**Source:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Productivity Data:**
- Yale CS data shows 5:1 to 10:1 productivity differences between programmers on identical tasks
- Top 25% performers (by code quality) still showed same massive time variations - quality and speed uncorrelated
- Standard deviation remained ~11 hours across all skill levels

**Economic Logic:**
- Software duplication is free, so programmer costs spread across all copies sold
- Design adds value faster than it adds cost
- Entertainment industry parallel: Brad Pitt's salary divided by millions of viewers
- Winner-take-all software markets mean you can't afford "good enough"

**Why More Bodies ≠ Better:**
- Brooks' Law: Adding programmers to late projects makes them later
- Single programmer has zero coordination overhead vs. team communication costs
- Five mediocre developers will never produce what one great developer creates

**The High Notes Problem:**
- Great software requires artistic/creative breakthroughs that average developers can't achieve
- Examples: Winamp's "Most things actually work!" copy, iPod's seamless design decisions
- Apple spent extra money on iPod thumbwheel speaker for tactile feedback rather than using headphones
- Style, happiness, and emotional appeal drive massive hits

**Market Reality:**
- Software is winner-take-all: only Apple profits from MP3 players, only Microsoft from office software
- "Remarkably good" means people literally remark about it
- Internal corporate IT can't justify rock star talent - product companies can

## Bottom Line
The 10x programmer productivity difference is real and measurable, but the creative "high notes" that separate great software from mediocre software are even more valuable and can't be achieved by adding more average developers.

# How To Hire World-Class Engineers

**Source:** https://angel.co/blog/how-to-hire-world-class-engineers
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Market Reality:**
- Only 1 in 100 engineers are unemployed; 50% plan to switch jobs within a year
- 50% of engineers would take less pay for better culture/brand
- 70% of companies make hiring decisions after 3 interview rounds

**Employer Branding (Critical First Step):**
- Hiring is marketing - build brand before sourcing
- Create "What it means to be an engineer at [Company]" content piece
- Document mission, culture, philosophy through engineering blogs
- Examples: Etsy's Code as Craft, Square's The Corner

**Sourcing Channels (Priority Order):**
1. **Referrals**: Lowest cost, highest trust, but risk homogeneity
2. **Hiring Platforms**: Fast but expensive (AngelList, LinkedIn)
3. **Outbound**: High quality but time-intensive
4. **Employer Brand**: Highest reach but requires sustained effort

**Screening Process:**
- Skip technical screening initially - do 30-min relationship building calls first
- Key screening questions:
  - "Why are you taking time to talk today?" (motivation)
  - "What's your proudest achievement?" (excitement factors)
  - "Recent article/repo recommendation?" (industry engagement)

**Interview Approach:**
- Practical over algorithmic: Test actual job skills, not whiteboard algorithms
- Design 2-3 hour projects mirroring real work
- Include collaboration with team member
- Ask candidates to explain decision-making process

**Closing Strategy:**
- Move fast - speed advantage over big tech
- Discuss compensation openly, no vagueness
- Stay responsive via text/immediate communication
- Showcase company passion and story

**Culture Fit Warning:**
- Early companies (1-10 employees): 50% prioritize culture fit most
- Larger companies (50+): Only 37.5% prioritize culture fit most
- Most "culture tests" actually test "Do I like this person?" leading to homogeneous teams

## Bottom Line
Treat engineering hiring as marketing: build authentic employer brand first, prioritize relationship-building over screening, use practical interviews over algorithms, and close with speed and transparency.

# Improving Our Engineering Interview Process

**Source:** https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/improving-our-engineering-interview-process-106173ba25a9
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

- **Replace phone screens with 3-hour take-home**: Single function coding question + data structure problem + short design doc (all based on real problems you've solved)
- **Anonymous grading eliminates bias**: Submissions go into code review tool, graded blind by different engineer using standardized rubric
- **Take-home performance strongly correlates with onsite performance** vs. phone screens which were "much more variable"
- **Onsite becomes code review discussion**: Candidate walks through their existing code on laptop, interviewer picks interesting parts to dive deeper - no live coding pressure
- **Eliminate low-signal elements**: Tests provided "basically no extra signal" and added time, so removed them entirely
- **Add scaffolding to save candidate time**: Pre-built framework reduces grunt work, makes auto-testing easier
- **Mention obvious/poor solutions upfront**: Since you can't course-correct live, explicitly call out naive approaches to avoid
- **Early bug-hunting format failed**: Having candidates find their own bugs was harder to conduct and less consistent than code review style

## Key Framework
1. Take-home (3 hours): 2 coding questions + design doc
2. Anonymous grading with rubric 
3. Onsite: collaborative code review of their work
4. Follow-up coding only for junior candidates

## Bottom Line
Take-home exercises based on real problems, graded anonymously, then discussed collaboratively onsite produces more accurate hiring signals than traditional phone screens and whiteboard coding.

# Lessons from Keith Rabois: How to Become a Magnet for Talent

**Source:** https://delian.io/lessons-5
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Pipeline Management:**
- First 10 hires set bar for next 90 - they'll recruit the rest
- Hiring process: LinkedIn DM → 30min phone screen → 1hr coffee → 4hr onsite
- Ratchet up time/resources based on likelihood of fit + candidate enthusiasm
- Use paid 3-day to 2-week trials before full offers
- Hire for what you know best first (counter-intuitive but you can assess fit better)

**Sourcing Strategy:**
- Tell your story publicly/loudly - financing announcements are for recruiting, not customers
- Target 15-20 later-stage companies with similar business models
- Look for employees with 2+ years experience, 1-2 prior jobs, showing upward trajectory
- Mine personal network of 50-100 most talented contacts first

**Candidate Assessment:**
- Meet with A+ talent in the field to build "taste" for quality (even if you can't hire them)
- Avoid risk-averse candidates - Google APM post-2008 grads have never founded billion-dollar companies
- Look for generalists who can become experts in 90 days
- Test willingness to work outside defined scope - early roles are fluid
- Speed to offer is startup's biggest advantage over large companies

**Cultural Standards:**
- Zero defects = not taking enough risk on high-upside candidates
- Fire quickly to maintain A+ culture - makes next 5 hires exponentially easier
- Bear markets create talent monopolies (PayPal example)

**Closing Tactics:**
- Custom company swag (running jacket example)
- Help with relocation/flexible start dates
- Candidate delays almost always mean rejection

## Bottom Line
Hire for potential over experience, maintain ruthlessly high standards, and use speed/storytelling as competitive advantages against larger companies.

# Lessons from Keith Rabois: How to Interview an Executive

**Source:** https://delian.io/lessons-2
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Value Creation vs Value Protection Framework:**
- Pre-Series B: hire ambitious risk-takers for value creation roles; accept some hiring mistakes
- Post-Series B: hire experienced, conservative operators for value protection (finance, legal, ops)
- Exception: regulatory-heavy companies may need protective roles early (Stripe hired GC as 10th employee)

**Owner Mentality Test:**
- Ask: "What would you have done differently at your last company if you had been CEO?"
- Good answers: substantive, well-thought strategies they've obsessed over
- Red flags: "CEO did everything right" or blaming specific teams vs owning with "I/we"

**Strategic Thinking Assessment:**
- Have them ask questions about your business equation and key levers
- Strong candidates probe like investors, uncover new levers you hadn't considered
- Weak candidates ask generic questions applicable to any business

**Risk-Strength Alignment:**
- Map company's existential risks against current team's strengths
- Hire for biggest gaps in highest-risk areas
- Ask candidates: "What are your strengths/weaknesses vs similar backgrounds?"

**Talent Magnet Evaluation:**
- Spend 15-20 hours with candidates on real work (90-day plans, memos, board deck analysis)
- They should have 5+ people ready to recruit immediately
- Reference calls with former directs: did they bring/retain/develop their team?
- Senior executives' primary function is building excellent teams

## Bottom Line

Executive hiring success depends on matching role type (value creation vs protection) to candidate profile, then rigorously testing for ownership mentality, strategic thinking, risk-strength fit, and team-building ability through extended real work sessions.

# The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing

**Source:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Hiring Decision Framework:**
- Only 2 outcomes: Hire or No Hire. Never "maybe," "hire but not for my team," or "I can't tell"
- If you're on the fence = No Hire. If you can't tell = No Hire
- Better to reject a good candidate than accept a bad one
- Require 6 interviewers minimum, 5 must be peers. If 2+ say no = don't hire
- Make decision within 3 minutes of interview ending, submit feedback within 15 minutes

**Core Criteria (Only Two Things Matter):**
- Smart: Can handle multiple levels of abstraction, explains things clearly, shows passion
- Gets Things Done: Historical evidence of overcoming obstacles and delivering results

**Interview Structure (1 hour minimum):**
1. Introduction (30 seconds)
2. Open-ended project questions (look for passion, clear explanation, leadership)
3. Easy programming question (filters out pretenders)
4. Pointer/recursion question (tests abstraction ability)
5. "Are you satisfied with that code?" (tests debugging)
6. Candidate questions + selling

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Don't research candidate beforehand - creates bias
- No trivia questions ("varchar vs varchar2 in Oracle")
- No brain teasers or "aha!" questions
- No illegal questions (demographics, military, family)
- Don't let one person interview multiple candidates simultaneously

**Technical Testing:**
- Pointers/recursion separate good programmers from script jockeys
- Speed on simple problems predicts advanced capability
- 20% hire rate from live interviews indicates good screening

## Bottom Line
Use exactly 2 criteria (smart + gets things done), require 6 interviewers, default to "no hire" for any uncertainty, and test programming fundamentals that reveal ability to handle abstraction.

# The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code

**Source:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**The Joel Test Framework:**
- 12 binary yes/no questions to rate software team quality in 3 minutes
- Scoring: 12 = perfect, 11 = tolerable, 10 or below = serious problems
- Most organizations score 2-3; companies like Microsoft run at 12

**Specific Performance Metrics:**
- Takes average 15 minutes to reach maximum productivity ("the zone")
- 1-minute interruption = 15 minutes lost productivity
- Bug fixing cost increases exponentially with time delay
- 1 tester per 2-3 programmers optimal ratio ($30/hour vs $100/hour programmer cost)
- 5-6 people sufficient for hallway usability testing (captures 95% of usability issues)

**Critical Implementation Details:**
- Daily builds at lunchtime prevent overnight breakage disasters
- Bug database minimum fields: reproduction steps, expected/observed behavior, assignee, fix status
- One-step build process prevents shipping errors during crunch time
- Separate offices vs open plan: 30 seconds lookup vs 15 minutes lost productivity trade-off
- "Zero defects methodology" = fix bugs before writing new code for predictable schedules

**Team Management:**
- Excel team rule: whoever breaks build babysits it until next person breaks it
- "No code without spec" enforcement prevents scope creep disasters
- Fast hardware/tools are cheaper than programmer frustration costs
- Coding interviews mandatory - resume chat insufficient

## Bottom Line

This 12-point checklist identifies fundamental engineering practices that separate high-performing software teams from dysfunctional ones, with specific metrics showing most teams operate at critically low efficiency levels.

# The Real 11 Reasons I Don't Hire You

**Source:** https://charity.wtf/2019/10/18/the-real-11-reasons-i-dont-hire-you/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights
- **Scarcity constraints**: Early-stage startups have few precious slots tied to specific company goals, unlike big tech "hire if qualified" approach
- **Team composition over individual merit**: Spend equal time analyzing team gaps (mentoring, technical specialties, future managers) as evaluating candidates
- **Diversity of experience matters more than demographics**: Avoid hiring all ex-FAANG/ex-MIT engineers who share same blind spots
- **Level balancing**: Teams need mix of seniority levels - too many senior engineers creates dysfunction, boredom, and stunted growth
- **Work availability matching**: Must have appropriate level of work - junior devs failed when only complex tasks available
- **Communication as core technical skill**: Technical interview requires explaining code changes to peers - "if you can explain what you did and why, you can do the work"
- **Startup reality check**: Red flag when candidates want startup experience but also demand predictability, strict hours, no on-call, high stability
- **Mission alignment litmus test**: "Because it was founded by women" as sole reason shows lack of genuine interest in problem/product
- **Success prediction**: Key question is "can we make this person successful in this role at this time?" considering skills, location, remote experience
- **Mutual fit assessment**: Only hire people whose hearts are in it and who see work as extension of themselves

## Bottom Line
Hiring decisions at constrained startups are primarily about team composition and mutual fit rather than individual capability assessments.

**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

**Top 10 System Design Interview Questions:**

1. **URL Shortener (TinyURL/Bitly)**: Generate unique IDs at scale (thousands/second), handle redirects, support custom URLs, delete expired URLs, track click stats

2. **Video Streaming (YouTube/Netflix)**: Store/distribute petabytes of data, handle simultaneous streaming for massive audiences, real-time video stats, live commenting systems

3. **Chat Service (WhatsApp/Messenger)**: One-on-one vs group chat architecture, offline message handling, push notification triggers, end-to-end encryption implementation

4. **Social Network/Forum (Reddit/Quora)**: Post statistics tracking, user following systems, timeline/newsfeed generation algorithms

5. **File Storage (Dropbox/Google Drive)**: File upload/search/sharing workflows, permission management, collaborative document editing

6. **Social Media (Facebook/Twitter)**: Efficient post storage/search, newsfeed generation (often consumes entire interview), social graph management for celebrity-scale followings

7. **Ride Sharing (Uber/Lyft)**: Driver-rider matching algorithms, geolocation storage for millions of moving objects, handling millions of location updates/second

8. **Search Services (Web Crawler/Type-Ahead)**: Query storage and freshness, real-time suggestion matching, handling fast typing, web page prioritization, infinite crawling prevention

9. **API Rate Limiter**: Request limiting within time windows (e.g., 15 requests/second), distributed system rate limiting, soft vs hard throttling

10. **Proximity Service (Yelp)**: Location-based search, distance/review ranking, population density-aware data storage

## Bottom Line

System design interviews test scalability thinking through 10 core patterns: unique ID generation, data distribution, real-time messaging, social graphs, file systems, matching algorithms, search indexing, rate limiting, and geospatial queries.

# Trouble hiring senior engineers? It's probably you

**Source:** https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/trouble-hiring/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights

- **Mindset shift**: When hiring senior engineers, you're selling, not buying - candidates choose you, not vice versa
- **Job posting optimization**: Most postings are 50%+ about what employer needs vs what they offer; should be reverse-optimized like candidate resumes
- **Information accessibility**: Make critical company info (management style, team size, tech stack, work environment, dress code) findable within one click of job posting
- **Interview process fixes**: 
  - Be on time and prepared
  - Read resume beforehand
  - Have structured approach
  - Answer candidate questions, don't just interrogate
  - Make quick decisions without being pushy
- **Technical assessments**: Do them last after making candidate want the job; let candidates choose between take-home vs on-site; make it collaborative, not a test
- **Skills evaluation**: Experienced engineers can often assess technical ability through conversation about projects and interests rather than formal coding tests
- **Company weakness strategy**: Know and openly communicate your limitations (no remote work, rigid hours) to avoid bad-fit hires
- **Process speed**: Respond quickly to applications; weeks of silence kills candidate interest

## Bottom Line
Successful engineering hiring requires flipping from a buyer mentality to a seller mentality - optimize every touchpoint to sell your opportunity to candidates who have multiple options.

# Visualizing Tech Company Layoffs in 2022

**Source:** https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-tech-company-layoffs-in-2022/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights
- Tech layoffs in 2022 tracked by multiple sites (Crunchbase, Inc42, trueup.io) - phenomenon widespread enough to require dedicated tracking
- Major cuts: Meta (first in 20-year history), Twitter (50% workforce + contractors), Byju's (2,500 employees, 5% of workforce), Peloton (staged cuts throughout year)
- Two primary drivers: economic uncertainty (external) and poor performance (internal)
- Goldman Sachs: Higher interest rates disproportionately impact tech because profits expected further out = greater duration risk
- Contributing factors: shrinking ad budgets, crypto market collapse
- Tech jobs = <3% of total US employment, limiting broader economic impact
- Tech workers have high likelihood of securing new jobs quickly
- US unemployment near 50-year low despite tech layoffs
- Employers avoid holiday season layoffs - December already showed 7,600 more cuts in first week
- Layoffs not US-exclusive: India's tech sector also cutting (Byju's example)

## Bottom Line
Tech layoffs in 2022 represented sector-specific adjustments to economic conditions rather than broader economic distress, with cuts concentrated in companies facing duration risk from higher rates and reduced ad spending.

# We Hire the Best, Just Like Everyone Else

**Source:** https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-hire-the-best-just-like-everyone-else/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights
- **Geographic diversity beats talent density**: Current Discourse team spans globally vs. cramming everyone within 30-mile SF radius - broader talent pool, better diversity outcomes
- **Audition projects > interviews**: 3-8 week paid contract work (10-20 hours/week) reveals actual job performance better than any interview process
- **"Hire the best" creates systematic bias**: Zero-doubt hiring standards accidentally optimize for "People Like Us" - same backgrounds, similar thinking patterns
- **Measured bias impacts**: Baseball cards held by black hands sell 20% less; orchestra blind auditions increased women's advancement 50%; both police and civilians 3x more likely to "shoot" black men in rapid-fire scenarios
- **Rejection costs are overstated**: Twitter evidence shows companies routinely wrong about passed-over candidates (Chris Wanstrath rejected by Yahoo before GitHub; Trek Glowacki tracking proves "almost always wrong")
- **Structure work for outsider onboarding**: If you can't successfully onboard a potential hire on small project, your new hire onboarding probably sucks too
- **Pay candidates for intensive evaluation**: Multi-day interview processes extract free labor; audition projects compensate fairly for real work
- **Most startups fail regardless of talent**: Statistical reality means "hire crazy risk junkies" might be more practical than "hire the best"

## Bottom Line
Replace traditional hiring gatekeeping with paid audition projects and geographic diversity to avoid systematic bias while actually evaluating job performance.

# Why Can't Programmers.. Program?

**Source:** https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/
**Section:** Hiring

---

## Key Insights
- 199 out of 200 programming job applicants cannot write any code whatsoever
- Majority of CS graduates fail "FizzBuzz" test: write program printing 1-100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", both with "FizzBuzz"
- Good programmers solve FizzBuzz in under 2 minutes; self-proclaimed senior developers take 10-15+ minutes
- Candidates with master's/PhDs fail basic tasks: "write loop counting 1-10" or "what's the number after F in hex?"
- Code samples required before phone interviews prevent wasting time on non-programmers
- On-site coding exercises (1-hour small application build) effectively screen candidates
- Pre-screening strategy allows interviews to focus on actual software engineering vs puzzle questions

## Bottom Line
The programming job market has a shocking signal-to-noise problem where 99.5% of applicants literally cannot code, requiring mandatory pre-screening with trivial programming tests before any interview time investment.

# People Management

# 10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman: What I Learned

**Source:** https://casnocha.com/reid-hoffman-lessons
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Speed & Decision Making**
- Make provisional decisions instinctually, then gather only the specific information needed to disprove them
- Accept 10-20% error rate from subordinates to enable fast decision-making
- If you need multiple reasons to do something, don't do it—find one decisive reason
- Focus completely on Phase 1; nothing else matters if you don't nail the foundation

**People Management**
- Categorize engagement levels: Principal (driving), Board Member (regularly involved), Investor (reactive support), Friend (casual)
- Trade up on trust even if trading down on competency—choose fast-learning friends over more qualified strangers
- People with "alpha streaks" can manage status needs; "repressed alphas" crave status but deny it
- Even people who claim they don't need flattery often still require some deference

**Strategic Frameworks**
- Every weakness has a corresponding strength—managing weaknesses may eliminate related strengths
- Values that actually shape culture have both upside and downside (all-positive values are meaningless)
- Sketch three scenarios for any project: upside, regular, downside outcomes
- Group complex options into "light/medium/heavy" or "easy/medium/hard" buckets

**Relationship Building**
- Help first when approaching powerful people—offer unique information or perspectives they can't buy
- Make people genuine partners, not just helpers—shared credit drives harder work
- Identify misaligned incentives explicitly with partners to avoid future surprises
- Respect "shadow power"—assistants, advisors, spouses who influence decision-makers

**Execution Principles**
- People closest to execution should modify strategy based on ground-truth details
- Reason is steering wheel, emotion is gas pedal—integrate feelings into rational process
- Root for people's better angels despite their flaws—maintain complex portraits of individuals

## Bottom Line

Speed and simplicity in decision-making, combined with generous partnership and truth-telling, creates exponentially more impact than perfectionist planning or political maneuvering.

# 12 manager readmes from top tech companies

**Source:** https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Manager README Framework (based on 12 top tech company examples):**

**Core sections all include:**
- Document purpose/context explanation
- About Me/My Job - role clarity and personal context
- Personal Principles/Values - default assumptions, mindsets, triggers
- One-on-Ones style - Most use weekly/bi-weekly 30min, employee controls agenda
- Feedback preferences - how to give/receive, comfort with directness
- Calendar interpretation - explicit availability promises despite packed schedules

**Optional but valuable sections:**
- Personal performance scales - Most use Red/Orange/Green system
- D.R.I. (Directly Responsible Individual) expectations
- Response time expectations by communication channel
- Work-life balance boundaries

**Specific practices from examples:**
- Scott (Stratasan): "Managers work for their direct reports" + "Inbox maintenance isn't what you're paid for"
- Matt (Etsy): Guests can edit calendar events by default + People > Process
- Elliott (RentTheRunway): Treats document as "promise" and asks to be held accountable
- Multiple managers: Include personal quirks/weaknesses they're working on

**Implementation best practices:**
- Deliver via 1:1 walkthrough (most effective method)
- Best timing: during employee or manager onboarding
- Consider hosting on GitHub for transparent version control

## Bottom Line

Manager READMEs create explicit working agreements that prevent misunderstandings and accelerate team relationships by documenting communication preferences, feedback styles, and management philosophy upfront.

# 44 Engineering Management Lessons

**Source:** https://www.defmacro.org/2014/10/03/engman.html
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Core Responsibilities**
- Act as information hub knowing what every engineer works on; connect dots that wouldn't otherwise connect
- Be tiebreaker when teams can't reach consensus, but don't make decisions unless necessary
- Enforce behavioral/performance standards: fire bullies and underperformers
- Stop coding features/fixing bugs - write code only to remain effective tiebreaker

**Decision Framework**
- When tiebreaking: Wait for all opinions, summarize all viewpoints clearly, list points of agreement, state what you learned, then decide
- Enforce decisions once made; don't let teams waste time in circles
- Reopen only with significant new information

**Conflict Resolution Process**
- Most conflict stems from people not feeling heard
- Sit with each person, ask how they feel, listen, ask again, summarize back to them
- Use non-violent communication for critiquing behavior without offense

**Performance Management**
- Evaluate monthly/quarterly, not daily
- If consistently wondering if someone's a good fit "for too long" - fire them
- Don't invent excuses to avoid firing; it's harder than it should be

**Authority Building**
- Authority earned through good decisions over time, not bestowed
- When people push boundaries, firm "I'm not ok with that" usually sufficient
- Show rough edge when pushed too far or lose team authority
- If saying "I'm not ok with that" repeatedly to same person - time to fire

**Emotional Intelligence**
- Most intellectual arguments have strong emotional undercurrents - identify them first
- Trust feelings when something seems wrong; don't let others bully you into ignoring intuition
- 95% of blame situations resolve through conversation

## Bottom Line
Engineering management is about being an information hub who makes tough decisions when needed while building authority through consistent good judgment and difficult conversations.

# 7 Ways to Set Up a New Hire for Success

**Source:** https://hbr.org/2019/05/7-ways-to-set-up-a-new-hire-for-success
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

• Hiring managers have the highest impact on new employee success because they best understand required skills, resources, and connections needed for effectiveness

• Create a structured 90-day onboarding plan with specific milestones and check-ins rather than ad-hoc introductions

• Assign a peer buddy (not just HR contact) who can answer practical day-to-day questions about systems, culture, and unwritten rules

• Schedule early wins - identify 2-3 small projects the new hire can complete in first 30 days to build confidence and credibility

• Introduce new hires to key stakeholders systematically with context about each relationship's importance to their role

• Set up weekly 1:1s immediately to provide feedback loops and course-correct before problems compound

• Document institutional knowledge and processes instead of relying on verbal knowledge transfer that gets forgotten

## Bottom Line

Hiring managers who create structured onboarding with early wins, peer support, and systematic stakeholder introductions dramatically increase new hire retention and time-to-productivity.

# A MANAGER’S BILL OF RESPONSIBILITIES (AND RIGHTS)

**Source:** https://charity.wtf/2019/10/30/a-managers-bill-of-responsibilities-and-rights/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Manager Rights:**
- Final say on hiring, firing, and leveling decisions (with team input but ultimate authority)
- Guaranteed honest, timely feedback from reports, peers, and leaders
- Tactical, strategic, and emotional support from other managers
- Mandatory self-care and real vacations
- Right to leadership coaching and career development
- Right to step down from management without pressure

**Manager Responsibilities:**
- Recruit, hire, train team; build emotional safety and team cohesion
- Actively redistribute opportunities; resist hiring monoculture
- Support individual career trajectories, work/life balance, team dynamics
- Monitor other teams for unsupported people; collaborate with peers to fix gaps
- Give feedback early/often; receive feedback gracefully; address hard issues with care
- Drive progress by preventing rabbit-holing; ensure redundancy in critical areas
- Own team planning process; be accountable for goals; communicate priorities clearly
- Manage calendar actively; be accessible; contain personal emotions (lean on manager/peers for support)
- Prioritize personal growth and model desired employee behaviors
- Maintain vulnerability

**Framework Structure:**
Rights establish what managers need to succeed; responsibilities define what they owe their teams and organization. Rights enable sustainable management; responsibilities drive team/company outcomes.

## Bottom Line
Effective management requires explicit rights (authority, support, development) paired with clear responsibilities (team care, progress, planning, feedback) to create sustainable leadership that serves both individuals and organizational goals.

# A Review Process

**Source:** https://capwatkins.com/blog/a-review-process
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Review Structure Framework:**
- Use organizational values (Leadership Principles) as evaluation rubric instead of role-specific skills
- Two-question format: "What 1-2 principles has this person embodied?" and "What 1-2 should they focus on?" with specific examples required
- Eliminates blank-page paralysis and vague feedback like "great to work with"

**Non-Anonymous Peer Reviews:**
- Managers compile all peer feedback with names attached in single Google Doc
- Manager acts as editor to check tone/ask for specifics before sharing
- Results in more meaningful feedback (people don't want colleagues seeing lazy one-liners)
- Enables direct peer-to-peer follow-up conversations post-review

**Level Calibration Process:**
- Create spreadsheet with role categories for each person
- Employee self-rates skill levels, manager rates separately
- Combine sheets and highlight discrepancies for discussion
- Reveals gaps in role documentation and creates alignment on performance expectations
- Common outcome: managers rate people higher than self-ratings

**Implementation Details:**
- Send reviews 1-2 days before conversation so reviewee can prepare
- Start review meetings with "What were the highlights? Any surprises?"
- Quarterly reduced to bi-annual frequency
- Process drives people to proactively seek clarification from peers

**Process Evolution:**
- Annual iteration on role documentation after review cycles
- Regular feedback collection through surveys and 1:1s
- Leadership Principles updated based on team input

## Bottom Line
Replace anonymous peer reviews with named feedback using organizational values as rubric, creating a calibration process that drives direct peer conversations and genuine performance alignment.

# A Tactical Guide to Managing Up

**Source:** https://review.firstround.com/a-tactical-guide-to-managing-up-30-tips-from-the-smartest-people-we-know
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Understanding Your Manager**
- Always align on two key questions: "What is success for me personally?" and "What is success for my manager's team?" - revisit these as company goals pivot
- Identify what signal your manager uses to determine trust (peer validation, metrics, testimonials) and tap into those mechanisms
- Focus on your manager's most urgent priorities and adjust accordingly - if you're not top of stack, do great work quietly until you are
- Propose solutions that solve both your problems AND your boss's problems one level up

**Communication Tactics**
- Use "rule of seven dippings" - complex ideas need multiple exposures over time before being internalized
- Observe how your manager listens and adjust delivery accordingly (e.g., lead with solution before problem if they race to find fixes)
- For micro-managers: provide comprehensive updates staying steps ahead; for hands-off managers: use 15% wins, 85% challenges ratio
- Separate general updates from specific requests - requests should be shorter and extremely clear on what you need

**Making Asks**
- Leave breadcrumb trails for big requests rather than saving everything for one perfect presentation
- Come with 2-3 options in table format showing lift, resources, pros/cons, and stakeholders needed
- Create shared understanding of constraints, unknowns, and alternative paths before proposing solutions

**1:1 Structure**
- Use shared doc with sections: FYIs, updates from both sides, follow-ups, discussion topics
- Start with bird's eye view of all projects before diving deep on any topic
- Grade yourself on alignment after each meeting - if consistently surprised, you need more signal throughout the week

**Self-Advocacy**
- Send weekly "State of Me" email with current priorities, things on your mind, and blockers needing help
- Create self-service status updates that managers can access asynchronously
- Use "FYI, no action" emails scheduled for convenient reading times

**Relationship Building**
- Don't seek to please your boss - push back when it's in company's best interest
- When given new tasks, respond with "Here's all my other priorities - where does this fall?"
- Train your manager on boundaries through actions, not explicit statements

## Bottom Line
Managing up is an ongoing investment in radical empathy - understand your manager's priorities, constraints, and communication style, then proactively provide the information they need in the format they best receive it.

# After Being A Manager, Can I Be Happy As A Cog?

**Source:** https://charity.wtf/2019/11/23/questionable-advice-after-being-a-manager-can-i-be-happy-as-a-cog/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Career Transition Reality:**
- After 2 years managing, you have ~2-3 more years before returning to IC becomes very difficult
- Senior ICs who've been managers wield outsized influence through "shadow management" and strategic advice
- Smart managers lean heavily on ex-manager ICs for mentorship, strategy, and organizational insight

**Management vs IC Power Dynamics:**
- Most orgs don't actively push back against power flowing from engineers to managers
- Going back to IC will feel like losing status/influence because in most places, it actually is
- Technical decisions should belong to technical people, but this only happens when senior ICs actively assert ownership

**Strategic Approach for Ex-Manager ICs:**
- Use management experience to organize other senior ICs to claim technical decision-making authority
- Leverage new "mystical aura" and leadership connections to advocate for better IC empowerment
- Target companies that use ICs at strategic/executive levels, not just tactical roles

**Organizational Change Framework:**
- Senior ICs must drive change in IC empowerment - managers won't give power they don't have to
- Model fluid movement between IC/management roles without promotion/demotion baggage
- Fight inherited command-and-control structures by creating better ones daily

**Age/Skills Concerns:**
- Technical skills are "the easy part" - business understanding and influence matter more
- 25 years of experience trumps kubernetes knowledge from 20-somethings

## Bottom Line
Use your management experience as a superpower to become an influential senior IC who shapes how organizations balance technical and people leadership, rather than seeing it as a step backward.

# Compensation Best Practices

**Source:** https://www.payscale.com/cbpr
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Voluntary turnover dropped to 13% in 2024** - cooling labor market giving employers more leverage over workers
- **Workplace flexibility correlates with retention** - median turnover rates lower for organizations with flexible policies
- **47% of organizations report tension between fair pay and cost optimization** - direct result of economic uncertainty and labor market power shift
- **Pay increases declining: 3.5% planned for 2025 vs 3.8% given in 2024** - roughly half of organizations actively reducing compensation spend
- **Pay equity analysis adoption surged to 57% vs 38% in 2020** - despite broader DEI pullback (only 11% plan to reduce DEI initiatives)
- **Pay transparency slightly declining: 56% publish ranges in 2025 vs 60% in 2024** - but organizations still want more transparency than current levels
- **Compensation strategy adoption hit majority for first time** - up from less than 1/3 in 2020 to majority in 2025
- **AI replacement intent: 18% actively replacing workers, 20% considering it** - 52% have no plans
- **Compensation maturity framework**: Only 1/3 of organizations are mature (Advancing/Optimizing stages), 2/3 still developing
- **Purpose-built compensation software strongly linked to advanced maturity stages** - lack of technology blocks maturity progress

## Bottom Line
Organizations are cutting pay increases and leveraging a cooler labor market while simultaneously investing in compensation strategy, pay equity analysis, and technology to manage growing tensions between cost control and fair pay.

# Cycle times

**Source:** https://boz.com/articles/cycle-times
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- Cycle time = vertical leaps × people per level. Reduce vertical leaps first as it affects both variables
- Push decision-making down to senior ICs rather than managers (who have overhead dealing with people issues)
- Manager performance should measure "return on investment" not "absolute impact"
- Use Single Threaded Owners: 100% focused individuals with no other responsibilities for critical work
- Product managers/PMMs should represent multiple disciplines to reduce meeting size - documents with 50 co-authors = poor ownership and diffuse accountability
- Make decisions on demos/prototypes instead of docs/decks for more durable outcomes
- Most companies over-parallelize and under-prioritize - doing less improves cycle time
- Identify critical bottleneck people early, inform them of importance, sequence their involvement properly
- Late feedback that restarts progress is particularly costly - front-load critical stakeholder input
- Bad processes cost several multiples more than good processes benefit
- Teams shift from proactive to reactive when processes slow down, undermining conviction and cohesion
- Small teams for senior managers enable faster decision-making

## Bottom Line

Optimize cycle time by pushing decisions down to senior individual contributors, using single-threaded ownership, limiting meeting participants through representatives, and making decisions on prototypes rather than documents.

# Design Patterns for Managing Up

**Source:** https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3308563
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**When You Don't Know the Answer:**
- Pattern: (1) Admit uncertainty, (2) Own the follow-up, (3) Give specific timeline, (4) Deliver concise response
- Example responses: "I don't know, but I can investigate and get back to you after lunch" or "I'll ask [name] and get back to you by end of day"
- Smart people don't know everything—they know where to find answers

**Managing Problems/Outages:**
- Always control the message—ensure leadership learns problems from you, not customers
- Pattern: (1) Establish yourself as owner working on solution, (2) Share known steps or commit to update timeline, (3) Give specific timelines for fixes or next updates
- Never say just "We're working on it"—always include when you'll provide next update
- Proactive communication prevents negative amplification during radio silence

**Disagreeing with Leadership:**
- Pattern: (1) Remove emotion (wait 1-2 days if needed), (2) Ask about context/reasons instead of disagreeing, (3) Start with direct manager before escalating, (4) Research and present alternatives achieving same goals, (5) Support the final decision and explain reasoning to your team
- Don't tell team "because [boss] made me do it"—explain the strategic reasoning
- Your job is company success, not 100% agreement with leadership

**Receiving Negative Feedback:**
- Single response pattern: "I hear you. I will be more mindful of that in the future."
- Focus on breathing, heart rate, relaxed face during delivery
- If emotional, leave immediately and follow up via email after collecting thoughts
- Feedback is opportunity to strengthen manager relationship when handled well

## Bottom Line
Pre-planned response patterns for high-stakes workplace situations prevent emotional reactions and position you as a problem-solving leader rather than someone making excuses.

# Draw The Owl and Other Company Values You Didn’t Know You Should Have

**Source:** https://firstround.com/review/draw-the-owl-and-other-company-values-you-didnt-know-you-should-have/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Value Articulation Framework:**
- Articulate values when you have 20-40 employees - not too early (3 people) or late (500+ people)
- Define values across 3 Ps: People (hiring/firing decisions), Product (features/customer treatment), Process (decision-making/accountability)
- Convene diverse group of 12, collect 100+ ideas, consolidate to 25, then apply "Oxygen Test" - keep only what you can't live without
- Use verbs, not adjectives - make them actionable commands under 5 words
- CEO leads but must include the tribe - values belong to everyone, not just leadership

**Living Values Daily:**
- Hire for capacity to live values, not perfect exhibition of them
- "Salt shaker principle" - staff will constantly move values off-center, your job is to consistently move them back without anger
- Fire incapable performers regardless of results; coach capable non-performers back to center
- Values are working when heard in hallways, board meetings, and noticed by outsiders
- Monitor unexpected interpretations - people will build from values in ways you never imagined

**Value Evolution:**
- Change values every few years maximum - quarterly changes make them strategies, not values
- Company may resist changes even when leadership sees need - respect tribal ownership
- Expect values to need refinement as company, product, and leadership mature

## Bottom Line
Values must be actionable verbs that guide daily decisions across people/product/process, lived consistently by leadership, and evolved carefully with tribal buy-in rather than top-down mandate.

# Hacking team communications

**Source:** https://noamelf.com/posts/hacking-team-communications/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Channel Setup:**
- Use Trello board subscriptions for instant progress notifications instead of email - reduces communication lag
- Subscribe to all GitHub repo activities, cancel email notifications, use in-app notifications with marking/muting features
- Apply strict email filters to eliminate irrelevant company-wide messages and error notifications from other teams
- Implement inbox zero methodology: address immediately or snooze to specific time

**Framework: Minimum Viable Tickets**
- Keep minimum number of tickets in each Kanban list (backlog, in progress, etc.)
- Sort tickets by priority within each list
- Link Pull Requests directly to tickets for code visibility
- Use "+1" emojis on ticket updates to show engagement and encourage continued updates

**Draft PRs Strategy:**
- Require team members to open PRs immediately, even incomplete work
- Use GitHub's "Draft PR" feature to reduce developer anxiety about early reviews
- Early PRs prevent conflicts by enabling feedback before significant time investment

**Meeting Optimization:**
- Default to 30-minute meetings, extend if needed rather than booking 1-hour slots
- Require meeting agendas - eliminates vague "discuss X" meetings
- Use "start with emails, escalate to meetings" hierarchy for conflict resolution

**Habit Formation Protocol:**
1. Explain why communication reduces future overhead
2. Set expectation: check channels twice daily minimum
3. Enforce "still in progress" responses rather than silence
4. Use gentle reminders ("did you check Trello recently?") after 4-hour non-response window

## Bottom Line
Replace status meetings with smart notification subscriptions, early draft PRs, and systematic habit formation through gentle enforcement of response expectations.

# Hold Your Team Accountable

**Source:** https://www.dave-bailey.com/blog/accountability-dial
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Accountability Definition:**
- To be accountable = provide an account of what's happening
- To hold accountable = ask questions about what's happening
- Core framework: "What happened?" and "This is what happened"

**The Accountability Dial (5 levels):**
1. The Mention: "Hey I noticed [behavior]... is everything okay?"
2. The Invitation: "I've mentioned [behaviors] a few times... what's the pattern?"
3. The Conversation: "[Behaviors] are impacting the team... let's discuss how to resolve"
4. The Boundary: "If [behaviors] don't change, we may have to consider [consequences]"
5. The Limit: "This is your final warning..."

**Critical Management Techniques:**
- Ask open questions vs. requests: "What will you do to make sure you arrive on time?" vs. "Please try to arrive on time"
- Distinguish excuses from reasons: Excuses assume no responsibility, reasons acknowledge personal role
- Don't solve problems immediately - ask "What will you do about it?" instead
- CEO suggestions often sound like decisions to teams - be careful with "suggestions"

**Consequence Types:**
- Protective consequences: Address actual business/team needs (removing remote work flexibility for chronic lateness)
- Punitive consequences: Designed to punish (excluding from company trip)
- Spectrum includes: reduced flexibility, role changes, formal warnings, extra training, termination

## Bottom Line
Effective accountability requires asking probing questions and resisting the urge to solve problems for your team, using escalating feedback levels while distinguishing between protective vs. punitive consequences.

# How to build a startup engineering team

**Source:** https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Founder Alignment**
- Establish role division before starting: CTO owns technical vision/architecture, VPE owns people/process/delivery
- Push back lightly when founders overstep, maintain clear signals to team about who handles what
- Create leverage by handling GitHub issues, build systems, recruiting, status updates while CTO focuses on prototypes/demos/tech exploration

**Team Structure**
- Minimum team size: 3 people (excluding manager), maximum: 10 people, ideal: 7-8
- Optimal composition: 1 staff engineer, 3 senior engineers, 4 engineers + 1 manager
- Build career ladder early as recruitment tool, not just management artifact
- Start simple: Engineer → Senior → Staff → Principal; EM → Senior EM → Director

**Release Strategy**
- Separate builds (continuous) from releases (scheduled)
- Internal releases: every 2 weeks for acceptance testing/risk reduction
- External releases: monthly for SaaS, quarterly for enterprise
- Use feature toggles for selective rollout
- Tailor cadence to customer consumption ability (enterprise needs slower releases due to compliance/security friction)

**Process Framework**
- "Use a process. Not too much. Mostly agile."
- Start minimal Kanban: To Do → Prioritized → In Progress → Blocked → Done
- Avoid naming methodologies directly to prevent dogma
- Regular retrospectives to modify frameworks, not treat them as rules

**Communication Rituals**
- Product reviews: demonstrate features to whole org, get stakeholder feedback, boost morale through visible progress
- Engineering reviews: technical deep-dives for engineers only, drive high-bandwidth communication across teams

## Bottom Line
Build startup engineering teams through clear founder role separation, small cross-functional teams (3-10 people), minimal but consistent process, and regular demo cycles that make progress visible to the entire organization.

# Hug your manager

**Source:** https://buttondown.email/cote/archive/hug-your-manager/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Managers as organization builders**: Beyond process enforcement, managers continuously build, define, and iterate on organizational structures—like product managers building apps
- **Agile vs. waterfall management**: Organizations that use iterative management (test theories, adapt, change) outperform those creating static "final" org charts upfront
- **Management release cycles**: Approximately 6-month cycles for organizational changes and adaptations
- **Invisible workload**: Most critical management work (building org structure, mediating conflicts, setting strategy) is least visible to employees
- **Continuous management needed**: Organizations require constant adjustment and "production support" like software systems—managers wear organizational "pagers"
- **Employee perspective gap**: Individual contributors often assume managers have complete plans when they're actually operating like product teams with evolving backlogs
- **Culture isn't execution**: Good culture is necessary but insufficient—actual management work (structure, procedure, policy) is the execution engine
- **Upward recursion of pressure**: Every level has someone above breathing down their neck, from employees to managers to executives to shareholders
- **Management transparency opportunity**: Managers should run retrospectives and post-mortems on organizational changes, sharing lessons learned with teams

**Specific Framework**: Treat organizational management like product development—start with theories, test in short cycles, iterate based on learning, maintain continuous improvement rather than big-bang reorganizations.

## Bottom Line
Most managers are actually running continuous product development cycles on the organization itself, but this critical work remains invisible to employees who should recognize and support these efforts.

# Increment: Teams

**Source:** https://increment.com/teams/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Small team focus**: Twilio scaled from 3 to 2,300 engineers by anchoring growth around small teams as the core organizational unit
- **Compensation equity framework**: Implement systematic pay audits and correction processes to prevent compensation inequity before it becomes entrenched
- **Distributed team systems**: Use deliberate communication systems (including emoji protocols) and structured processes to maintain efficiency across geographic boundaries
- **Engineering manager technical requirements**: Technical depth matters less than ability to make sound technical decisions and earn team credibility
- **Interview process redesign**: Shift from "culture fit" to inclusion-focused interviews that promote positivity and assess actual job-relevant skills
- **Value over volume metrics**: Reward engineering impact and problem-solving capability rather than lines of code or feature count
- **Human factors dominate quality**: Studies show team dynamics and human factors influence software quality more than technical tooling choices
- **Cross-functional skill integration**: Diverse skill sets (design, copywriting, domain expertise) significantly improve software project outcomes
- **Editorial process adoption**: Engineering teams can learn from editorial organizations' paper-and-lore-based processes that consistently ship on schedule
- **Management transition framework**: Provide structured paths and training for developers moving from individual contributor to engineering management roles

## Bottom Line

Focus on small team structures, human-centered processes, and systematic equity practices rather than purely technical solutions when scaling engineering organizations.

# Individuals matter

**Source:** https://danluu.com/people-matter/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Heavy-tailed returns make individual differences critical**: When the right person can increase revenue by 0.7% on paternity leave alone, treating people as fungible becomes extremely costly
- **Team destruction is asymmetric**: Effective teams take time to build due to institutional knowledge and culture, but are easily destroyed by forced reassignments
- **Senior ICs predict reassignment failures accurately**: Management persists in thinking people can be redirected like SimCity workers despite consistent IC predictions of failure
- **Promotion incentives misalign with value creation**: Companies explicitly tie promotions to headcount managed rather than outcomes, encouraging empire-building over effectiveness
- **Bureaucratic processes create competitive disadvantage**: Companies with streamlined technical blog approval processes gain significant advantages over those with onerous review processes
- **$500B+ companies succeeded through aggressive non-bureaucratic moves**: Large winners made bets that wouldn't have been possible at bureaucracy-heavy competitors
- **Claimed wins often don't match actual results**: Internal analysis typically shows claimed revenue/growth wins are inflated compared to observable totals
- **Location-based pay adjustments backfire in remote work era**: Companies maintaining severe geographic pay differences lose talent to competitors with smaller adjustments
- **Winner-take-most markets punish lowest-common-denominator approaches**: Forcing uniform effectiveness ensures being an "also ran" in tech markets

## Bottom Line

In heavy-tailed outcome distributions, treating individuals as fungible and optimizing for bureaucratic legibility over individual effectiveness costs companies the majority of their potential returns.

# Lessons from Keith Rabois: How to be an Effective Executive

**Source:** https://delian.io/lessons-3
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Personal Effectiveness:**
- Output = (your team's output + neighboring teams' output) / team size. Only hire if they raise this ratio
- Judge team on inputs (quality of thinking) not outputs (revenue targets) to encourage high-upside experiments vs. safe projects
- Spend 80% of time on top 3 weekly priorities. Do calendar audits monthly, categorizing time spent
- Focus on limiting step (bottleneck) - dedicate 20-80% of time to the single constraint blocking progress
- Batch similar tasks to reduce context switching costs

**Information Gathering:**
- CEOs judged on ~4 critical decisions per year. Spend most time gathering unfiltered information
- Walk around office, do skip-level meetings to bypass filtering layers
- Use weekly written reports to force clarity of thinking (benefits writer more than reader)

**Team Management:**
- Pair all metrics to prevent gaming (e.g., fraud loss rate + false positive rate)
- Simplify to ONE objective - each logical step loses 20-40% team performance
- Four meeting types: 1:1s (junior sets agenda), staff meetings (affects 2+ people), decision meetings, operational reviews
- Make decisions by knowledge not position when possible. Push decisions to lowest competent level

**Performance Framework:**
- Motivation vs. capability: If they could do it "if life depended on it" = motivation problem (your fault). If not = capability mismatch
- Task-relevant maturity determines management style: low experience = micromanage, high experience = hands-off
- Extend rope when downside is low, conviction is low. Always expand scope until people hit breaking point, then pull back

## Bottom Line
Maximize leverage by focusing on inputs over outputs, spending 80% of time on top priorities, and pushing decisions to the lowest competent level while extending team members' scope until they break.

# Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule

**Source:** http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Two schedule types**: Manager's schedule (1-hour blocks, constant task switching) vs. Maker's schedule (half-day minimum chunks for deep work)
- **Meeting cost differential**: For managers, meetings are low-cost slot-filling; for makers, one meeting can destroy an entire day's productivity
- **Cascading effect**: Knowing about an afternoon meeting reduces morning ambition - makers avoid starting complex tasks when interruption looms
- **Power imbalance**: Most executives operate on manager's schedule and can force their rhythm on makers, but smart ones restrain themselves
- **Office hours solution**: Cluster all meetings at day's end to simulate manager's schedule within maker's framework - prevents interruption of deep work blocks
- **Time partitioning hack**: Split day into two workdays - one for "business stuff" (manager mode) and one for creating (maker mode, often late night when interruptions impossible)
- **Speculative meetings**: "Grab coffee" meetings are essentially free for managers but catastrophically expensive for makers
- **Communication gap**: Most people assume everyone runs on manager's schedule, creating bind where makers must choose between productivity loss or relationship damage

## Frameworks
- **Office hours clustering**: Batch all meetings at day's end
- **Dual workday split**: Separate creation time from administrative time completely

## Bottom Line
Understanding the fundamental incompatibility between manager's hourly scheduling and maker's deep-work blocks is crucial for protecting team productivity and avoiding costly interruptions to creative work.

# Mandate Levels

**Source:** https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-2752-mandate-levels
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **9 Mandate Levels Framework**: Work ranges from very specific (A) to very general (I), defining spheres of authority and autonomy
- **Team comparisons reveal structure**: Team operating at metric-defined bets vs. customer segment + activity shows different empowerment levels
- **Role boundaries matter**: Rigid boundaries (developers A-C, product owner D) vs. overlapping mandates in product-led companies
- **"Trio" model**: Designer, lead developer, product manager share higher mandates while other developers max at Level C (risk: boredom)
- **Work is fractal**: Activity happens at all levels simultaneously; question is who operates where
- **Mandate ownership ≠ isolation**: Others will still be interested in your work and resulting lower-level tasks
- **Architecture constrains empowerment**: Current org structure and systems may limit mandate level options regardless of intent
- **Experience gates capability**: New developers may find Level D daunting; veterans may leave if capped below Level X
- **OKR trap**: Can't fake mandate levels by asking teams to create OKRs they can't actually control or influence
- **Dynamic mandates**: Levels can shift during initiatives - often starting high then trending lower as learning occurs
- **Anti-pattern**: "Annual planning" requests often cause premature convergence and reduce everyone's mandate levels

## Bottom Line
Replace vague "empowerment" talk with specific mandate level discussions to clarify who has authority to make what types of decisions across the work spectrum.

# Meetings for an effective eng organization

**Source:** https://lethain.com/eng-org-meetings/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Core Meeting Structure:**
- 6 essential meetings: 3 operational (weekly team, tech spec review, incident review), 2 developmental (staff engineers monthly, eng managers monthly), 1 communication (monthly eng Q&A)
- Weekly team meetings should include cross-functional partners (recruiting, people, finance) to resolve issues immediately vs backlogging
- Tech spec/incident reviews fail when they become presentations; succeed when anchored in audience feedback and discussion
- Require reading documents before reviews - block 30 minutes on calendars for pre-reading

**Scaling Guidelines:**
- <20 engineers: only need weekly team meeting
- Scale operational meetings for right participants (split mobile reviews if audience lacks mobile context)
- Scale developmental meetings for engagement (max 10 people or participation drops)
- Split meetings for bad actors is wrong approach - hold individuals accountable instead

**Q&A Meeting Mechanics:**
- Use voting tools for question prioritization, support anonymous questions
- Start with "no questions off limits" disclaimer
- Highlight individual contributors when answering relevant questions
- Alternate time slots across time zones vs increasing frequency
- Don't record Q&As (reduces question quality)

**Execution Details:**
- Maintain running agendas in group-editable documents
- Find dedicated owners for spec/incident reviews (high-impact leadership opportunities)
- 1:1 cadence: weekly with directs, weekly with 3 closest exec peers, monthly with other peers
- Skip-levels: allocate fixed 1-2 hours/week, adjust format to stay within budget

## Bottom Line
Meetings are backup communication solutions that become essential at scale - focus on 6 core types with specific formats and ruthlessly optimize for participant engagement over convenience.

# non-violent communication

**Source:** https://review.firstround.com/power-up-your-team-with-nonviolent-communication-principles
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Four-Step Nonviolent Communication Framework:**
1. **Observation**: State facts without judgment ("I see that you want this..." not "You don't respect your colleagues")
2. **Emotional Audit**: Use specific feeling words that don't blame others ("I feel tired" not "I feel unheard")
3. **Needs**: Identify what's missing ("I need space/appreciation/support")
4. **Requests**: Build flexibility into asks ("Would you be willing to..." not demands)

**A-E-I-O-U Conflict Resolution Model:**
- **Acknowledge**: State their positive intentions out loud
- **Express**: Use "I think/I feel" statements for your concerns
- **Identify**: Propose solutions with "I would like..." (not "I want...")
- **Outcome**: Explain benefits for them, offer recognition
- **Understanding**: Ask for feedback, allow face-saving exits

**Implementation Tactics:**
- Model behavior first—formal rollouts backfire
- Ask people to repeat back instructions to check understanding
- Use moderators for heated conflicts
- Ask resisters: "What do you ultimately want to achieve?"
- Take breaks/walks to reset escalated conversations
- Reference shared history/early days to realign teams

**Key Metrics:**
- Teams working 12-14 hour days need open questions, not closed yes/no demands
- Early conflicts affect entire teams in startups due to small size
- Higher interpersonal skills correlate with increased productivity and satisfaction

## Bottom Line
Replace fear-based closed questions with open ones using structured frameworks to transform team productivity and prevent small conflicts from destroying startups.

- Tailored onboarding plans based on individual learning styles and experience

**Implementation Tactics:**
- Day 1 team lunch is non-negotiable
- Create "circle of friendly faces" beyond just the buddy
- Act as "cultural interpreter" for company acronyms/customs
- Multi-week gradual learning curve prevents information overload
- Pet projects balance learning efficiency with practical application
- Wiki system captures institutional knowledge from all past onboardings

**Feedback Loop:**
- Post-onboarding feedback sessions without managers present
- Newcomers update documentation to help future hires
- Mentorship treated as career growth milestone and "rite of passage"

**Key Principle:** 
Primary KPI is time until newcomer refers to company as "we" instead of "you"

## Bottom Line
Engineer-owned onboarding with dedicated champions, tailored learning plans, and systematic knowledge retention achieves 98% three-month retention while building mentorship culture.

# Principles of Engineering Management

**Source:** https://medium.com/swlh/principles-of-engineering-management-c9cae1b34a8b
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Manager's Core Role:**
- Purpose: Clarify the "why" behind all work - motivation, scope, focus come from explaining why
- People: Ensure team has right skills, motivation, and understanding
- Process: Remove roadblocks, establish clear decision makers

**Management Self-Assessment Questions:**
- Do you find outcome achievement more motivating than playing a specific role?
- Can you be emotionally stable in challenging situations?
- Do you like talking to people extensively?

**Trust Building (Most Critical Asset):**
- Responsibility lies more with manager than direct report
- Reports naturally fear appearing as complainers/failures
- Must create environment where complete honesty has no retribution

**Feedback Framework:**
- Give task-specific feedback on deployments, meetings, code reviews
- Dedicate one 1-1 every two months specifically to growth/behavioral feedback
- Be as specific with praise as with criticism

**Proactive Management Rules:**
- All projects must be documented thoroughly
- No single gatekeeper of knowledge - spread across team/org
- Write down architectural decisions for future reference
- People leave due to: lack of growth, autonomy, or compensation

**Performance Issues Diagnosis:**
- Skills problem: Help learn or hire someone with skills
- Motivation problem: Unclear expectations, disinterest, or no rewards/penalties
- Solve through honest conversations only

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Replace your presence with documentation
- Create FAQ for repeated questions
- Makes team self-sufficient and unblocks people

## Bottom Line
Management success hinges on building trust through radical honesty, replacing yourself with documentation/processes, and proactively diagnosing whether performance issues stem from skills gaps or motivation problems.

# Should I Become a Manager?

**Source:** https://capwatkins.com/blog/should-i-become-a-manager
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Management = Complete Career Reset**: New managers are shocked by initial incompetence - 1:1s, organizational navigation, process creation, and constant scrutiny are entirely different skills from technical craft
- **Contributor Track Limitations**: 99.9% of VP/Director-level roles require management; contributor advancement is exponentially harder due to need-based manager role creation vs. limited senior IC positions
- **Pay/Authority Gap**: Despite company claims of "parallel tracks," contributors cannot achieve same compensation and influence as managers at equivalent levels
- **Accountability Filter**: Core decision criterion should be desire for accountability - successful managers want to be "on the hook" when things go wrong, not just when they go right
- **Peter Principle Prevention**: Each management level (IC→Manager→Director→VP) requires fundamentally different skills; promotions fail when people take roles they don't want accountability for
- **Readiness Paradox**: Caring about doing a good job is the strongest predictor of management success; those who worry about preparedness perform best because they seek feedback and learn fastest
- **No Preparation Substitute**: Direct experience is the only real training for people management - theoretical preparation has limited value
- **Reversibility Safety Net**: Management isn't permanent - technical expertise doesn't disappear, and returning to IC roles is common and acceptable

## Bottom Line
Choose management based on desire for accountability rather than career advancement, since the role requires completely new skills but remains reversible if it doesn't fit.

# Step by step guide to building high performing teams

**Source:** https://mm-coaches.notion.site/Step-by-step-guide-to-building-high-performing-teams-a1d3c70c031144738943e043933d3267
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**High Performer Characteristics:**
- Work within their Zone of Genius (ZoG) majority of time; proactively outsource/delegate weaknesses
- Use "Issue + Proposed Solution" framework when presenting problems
- Apply "I intend to..." communication vs asking permission
- Balance asking for help with independent problem-solving; clearly state request + prior work done

**3-Step Framework:**
1. **Hire/Fire Well:** Use 30-60-90 plans, anti-sell techniques, ruthless culture fit screening
2. **Create Trust:** Achieve through clarity + care + transparency + consistency
3. **Ongoing Development:** Provide continuous challenge beyond 90-day onboarding

**Trust Building Tactics:**
- Day 1: Establish working agreements, define excellence standards, confirm 30-60-90 expectations
- Monthly: Run "Magic Questions" with direct reports
- Quarterly: Discuss progress against direct report's 5-year professional dream
- Monthly minimum: Give clear, unbiased absolute feedback

**Management Delegation:**
- Can delegate trust-building tools to COO/CoS/VP HR
- Never outsource: direct feedback delivery and remembering personal info of direct reports

**Performance Standards:**
- High performers expect other high performers (positive-sum mindset)
- Clear talent density requirements for graceful underperformer exits
- Feedback is prerequisite to high performance; trust is prerequisite to feedback

## Bottom Line
Building high-performing teams requires a systematic approach of rigorous hiring, trust-building through consistent transparency and care, and ongoing development that challenges top talent.

# The Engineer/Manager Pendulum

**Source:** https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

- **Manager timing rule**: Best engineering managers are never more than 2-3 years removed from hands-on technical work
- **Pendulum career path**: Alternate between IC and management roles instead of picking one track permanently
- **Skills decay principle**: You can only improve at engineering OR management at one time - management kills engineering skills through constant interruptions
- **Tech lead requirement**: Best tech leads have management experience because they understand people/process, not just code
- **Management reality**: It's a lateral career move, not a promotion - you become junior-level in new skills
- **Core conflict**: Great engineering requires focused attention; management requires being interruptible - these are mutually exclusive
- **Business context**: Being an IC is "reverse-engineering how a company works with very little information" - management teaches you how business actually operates
- **Hybrid role instability**: Manager+tech lead combinations decay over time as engineering context gets stale
- **Assignment principle**: Managers must hand off challenging work to engineers to help them grow
- **Misery indicator**: If you don't think you're bad at management when you start, you're not doing the job properly

## Bottom Line
The most effective technical leaders oscillate between individual contributor and management roles every 2-3 years to maintain both technical credibility and people skills.

# The Manager FAQ

**Source:** https://www.seebs.net/faqs/manager.html
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Manager Value Proposition:**
- Good managers can increase productivity 5-10x by "running interference" - handling external interactions so workers can focus
- Management most useful in: large/high-turnover environments, jobs with heavy incoming information, work with significant obstructions
- Management may interfere with: creative work, fundamental engineering/research

**Communication Frameworks:**
- Treat manager requirements like any other source - assume they know more about business context than you do
- For design work complaints: Document progress through whiteboards, papers summarizing issues - helps clarify your thinking and shows visible progress
- When stuck: Use "lost keys" analogy - explain why you can't just keep searching the same places repeatedly

**Workplace Navigation:**
- Formal dress/titles are part of manager's job to interact with corporate hierarchy, not personal preference
- When identifying coworker problems: Take manager aside with details, don't nag, focus on helping solve rather than complaining
- For boring work requests: Explain task necessity, get "general troubleshooting" added to job description, document usefulness with testimonials

**Salary/Career Issues:**
- If you earn as much as manager: Request extended benefits or freelance consulting permission as alternatives
- When offered management roles: Explain you enjoy current work for its own merits, not as advancement stepping stone

**Estimation Pressure:**
- Managers need predictable schedules for business planning/payroll
- Always provide estimates even when uncertain - warn about inaccuracy and use "lost keys" analogy for creative work unpredictability

## Bottom Line
Managers handle business context and external friction you don't see, so treat their requests as valid requirements while communicating your work's nature through visible documentation and concrete analogies they can understand.

# The mythical 10x programmer

**Source:** http://antirez.com/news/112
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Multiplier Effect Theory**
- Programming productivity isn't linear like construction work - design disciplines have multiplicative advantages where experience, knowledge, and pattern recognition compound together
- 10x difference emerges most in goal-oriented tasks where programmers can redesign approaches, less in rigid spec-following scenarios

**Core Performance Drivers**
- **Design sacrifice**: Kill 5% of features to achieve 90% of value - complexity often comes from unwillingness to drop non-fundamental goals
- **Focus quality over quantity**: Actual coding time matters more than total hours; eliminate meetings, open offices, frequent interruptions
- **Pattern matching through experience**: Knowing pre-explored solutions prevents design errors and reduces implementation time

**Specific Productivity Killers**
- **Perfectionism**: Engineering culture focused on measurable performance metrics creates design bias, ignoring robustness/simplicity/delivery speed
- **Design error accumulation**: Each wrong design choice leads to complex workarounds instead of re-design, compounding complexity exponentially
- **Poor debugging skills**: Can consume enormous time; combine incremental state-gathering with simple code that's less bug-prone

**Technical Foundations**
- **Low-level understanding**: C competence, CPU/kernel knowledge prevents late-stage architectural failures requiring complete rewrites
- **Theoretical knowledge**: Understanding data structures, computational limits, algorithms (e.g., probabilistic cardinality estimators) enables elegant solutions

**Opportunistic Programming Strategy**
- At each development step, choose features with maximum user impact requiring minimum effort
- Mental "proof of concepts" allow exploring multiple simple designs before implementation

## Bottom Line
10x programmers exist because programming is a design discipline where experience, focus, willingness to sacrifice features, and technical depth create multiplicative (not additive) productivity gains.

# The Power of Performance Reviews

**Source:** https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-performance-reviews-use-this-system-to-become-a-better-manager/
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Preparation (3-5 hours per direct report):**
- Gather feedback using 3 simple questions: What should they start/continue/stop doing?
- Form your own opinion before collecting peer feedback to avoid bias
- Identify 1-2 development areas max (more than 2 prevents meaningful progress)
- Include specific examples, concrete improvement suggestions, and "killing it" vision
- Define timeline to next level: 6-12 months (typical), 6 months (close to promotion), 12-18 months (just promoted)

**Delivery Framework:**
- Schedule 45 minutes + 30 minutes prep time
- Send document 2-4 hours before meeting for processing time
- Bring printed copies with highlighter
- Share rating first (people can't focus until they know)
- Spend 2/3 of meeting on development area details
- End with compensation updates and action planning

**Follow-up System:**
- Create monthly 1-hour "Career Coaching" meetings (separate from weekly 1:1s)
- Build 5-7 concrete action items in shared spreadsheet with status colors
- Report leads the monthly check-in, manager asks questions vs. giving answers
- Keep running Google Doc of noteworthy instances throughout the year

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Spending less than 3 hours preparing
- Over-relying on peer feedback (high performers often ruffle feathers)
- Including too many development areas
- Having one-sided conversations
- No follow-up structure

**Template Structure:**
- Accomplishments + positive peer quotes
- Superpower identification
- High-level narrative (4-6 sentences)
- Development areas with examples and improvement suggestions

## Bottom Line
Transform performance reviews from dreaded chores into career acceleration tools by spending 3-5 hours preparing structured feedback, limiting focus to 1-2 development areas, and implementing monthly follow-up coaching sessions with concrete action items.

# The Secret To Discussing Pay With Employees

**Source:** https://www.officevibe.com/blog/secret-to-discussing-pay-with-employees
**Section:** People Management

---

## Key Insights

**Context is Critical**
- 82% of employees believe they're paid below market rate (most are wrong due to lack of context)
- 44% of employees who feel underpaid actually earn market rate or above
- Employees create their own narratives about pay when context is missing, leading to resentment

**3 Core Areas Managers Must Understand**
1. **Company Compensation Philosophy** - Link pay decisions to company values/goals to answer "why this amount?"
2. **Market Positioning** - Know how company sets ranges, stays competitive, and compares to competitors
3. **Salary Adjustment Process** - Understand frameworks for increases, promotions, bonuses, role changes

**Communication Framework**
- Decouple pay conversations from performance reviews
- Tie performance to development/growth, pay to market standards
- Provide non-monetary recognition alongside financial explanations
- Train managers on compensation rationale before they communicate numbers

**Key Statistics**
- Pay transparency issues cause more departures than actual low pay
- Fair compensation is baseline requirement before employees prioritize growth/purpose
- Lack of context drives perceived unfairness even when compensation is market-appropriate

**Implementation**
- Managers should request proper training on compensation reasoning from HR
- Stay current on industry market data throughout the year
- Position compensation as story of how organization values employees

## Bottom Line
Pay communication failures stem from lack of context, not actual compensation levels - train managers on the "why" behind numbers to prevent employee turnover driven by perceived unfairness.

# Career Growth Frameworks in Software Engineering: A Review

**Source:** https://web.archive.org/web/20210123114037/https://medium.com/better-programming/career-growth-frameworks-in-software-engineering-a-review-4aa6c59a9cf6
**Section:** Career growth

---

## Key Insights

**Historical Context & Problems**
- Career ladders stem from Taylorism/Fordism industrial models that treated workers as replaceable cogs - incompatible with knowledge work
- Peter Principle: employees get promoted to their level of incompetence
- Dual-track ladders (management vs technical) fail because technical roles still viewed as inferior "workers"

**Motivation Framework**
- External rewards (pay, titles) cease motivating once basic fairness achieved and can actually diminish performance
- Three intrinsic motivators: Mastery, Autonomy, Purpose (Daniel Pink's "Drive")
- Quote: "Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave"

**Developer Performance Measurement**
- Individual developer productivity cannot be objectively measured - all attempts fail
- Metrics like lines of code, hours worked, story points useful for teams/projects but useless for individual assessment
- Software engineers are architects, not brick layers - their goal is building product, not writing code

**Company Approaches**
- Netflix: Flat structure, no formal framework
- Spotify: Delayed framework 8 years (admits too long), then skill matrix
- Google: Dual-track works at scale, flat structure failed spectacularly
- Medium: Abandoned holacracy due to overhead/scaling issues

**Common Patterns**
- Skill matrices nearly universal among progressive companies
- Separate growth frameworks from external titles
- Growth frameworks inseparable from company culture
- Level reflects abilities, doesn't define them

**Implementation Framework**
1. Define company values first - culture is what you do, not what you say
2. Decide salary transparency and title approach upfront (hardest to retrofit)
3. Regular 1:1 meetings - nothing in performance reviews should surprise
4. Fair competency matrix describing tasks/behaviors (not metrics)
5. Defined compensation review process

**Key Trade-offs**
- Hierarchy depth vs flatness
- Titles vs roles vs no-titles  
- Centralized vs distributed decision-making
- Open vs closed salaries
- Early framework vs delayed implementation
- Conventional vs experimental approaches

## Bottom Line
Skip complex performance measurement systems and focus on regular feedback through competency matrices that support intrinsic motivation (mastery, autonomy, purpose) rather than trying to objectively rank individual developer productivity.

# Software Engineers Growth framework

**Source:** https://prontopro.engineering/blog/software-engineer-growth-framework
**Section:** Career growth

---

## Key Insights

**Framework Structure:**
- 2 tracks (Individual Contributor, Manager) × 5 levels = 10 distinct roles
- 5 shared KPIs across all roles: Product, Technology, People, Process, Area of Impact
- Each KPI has 5 steps with increasing expectations by level

**Promotion Philosophy:**
- Promotions are descriptive, not prescriptive - promote after demonstrating next-level performance
- "5 C's" criteria: Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent, Competency at next level
- New responsibilities come first, recognition follows

**Key Role Transitions:**
- Junior → Software Engineer: Move from individual focus to team impact
- Senior → Principal/Staff: Split into technical mastery (Principal) vs cross-team coordination (Staff)
- Level V: Chapter Lead focuses on community impact, Engineering Manager on people management

**Evaluation Scale:**
- 4-point scale from "does not meet" to "exceeds most expectations"
- Examples are illustrative, not prescriptive checklists

**Scaling Triggers for Framework Redesign:**
- Team growth: 5 → 20+ engineers over 4 years
- Structure shift: Functional silos → cross-functional teams
- Metrics evolution: Quantitative KPIs (velocity) → qualitative KPIs (impact)

**Framework Sources:**
- Analyzed 19 company frameworks (Spotify, Medium, Buffer, etc.) before customizing
- Framework must address company-specific needs, not copy-paste from others

## Bottom Line
A promotion framework works best when it uses consistent KPIs across all levels, promotes based on demonstrated performance rather than promises, and evolves with company structure and values.

# The Reverse Interview: How To Choose Your Next Company

**Source:** https://www.reforge.com/blog/reverse-interview
**Section:** Career growth

---

## Key Insights

**The Power Imbalance**
- 90% of interview time focuses on company evaluating you, only 10% for your questions
- Short-term job hops damage resumes; companies screen for this pattern
- Company success impacts your career trajectory more than most realize - fast-growing companies create promotion opportunities through need + capability

**5-Step Reverse Interview Framework**
1. Self + peer assessment of strengths/weaknesses
2. Define what you want from next role
3. Identify companies that match criteria
4. Get insider information to filter options
5. Come more prepared than they do

**High-Impact Question Techniques**
- Give context that shapes their perception: "I connect my work to strategic picture, so..."
- Ask for specific examples: "What have you chosen NOT to do because of this strategy?"
- Recast understanding back to deepen discussion
- Use follow-ups: "Can you tell me more about X?" "Do you have an example?"

**Critical Areas to Probe**
- Role autonomy: "What decisions do I make alone vs. with input?"
- Team structure: "How is this team organized within broader company?"
- Role progression: "Who succeeded in this role? What capabilities did they show?"
- Company perception: "What's the biggest risk you'd take hiring me?"

**Tactical Execution**
- Evaluate company, team, AND role together - don't over-focus on one
- Early-stage companies: prioritize company/team evaluation
- Later-stage companies: focus on personal fit
- Always ask for more time if needed during "sell" stage
- Back-channel them like they back-channel you
- Interview success = 50% marketing, 50% capabilities (not 10/90)

## Bottom Line
Career decisions are high-stakes with asymmetric risk, so flip the script by coming more prepared than your interviewer and asking questions that reveal reality behind their sales pitch.

# Project management

# Evidence Based Scheduling

**Source:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/
**Section:** Project management

---

## Key Insights

**Core EBS Method:**
- Break tasks into 16-hour maximum chunks to force detailed design thinking
- Track actual time vs. estimates to calculate "velocity" (estimate/actual) for each developer
- Use Monte Carlo simulation with historical velocities to generate probability curves, not single dates
- Run 100+ scenarios using randomly selected velocities from each developer's history

**Velocity Patterns:**
- Perfect estimator: {1, 1, 1, 1...} - mythical
- Bad estimator: {0.1, 0.5, 1.7, 13.0...} - creates wide probability curves
- Common estimator: {0.6, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7...} - consistent underestimation, narrow curves

**Interruption Handling:**
- Don't track interruptions separately - just keep clock running on original task
- EBS automatically accounts for unpredictable delays through velocity history
- Produces correct schedules regardless of tracking method

**Project Management Rules:**
- Only programmers doing the work create estimates
- Charge bug fixes to original task time
- Never let managers pressure for shorter estimates
- Schedule = box of blocks: get bigger box or remove blocks, can't shrink blocks
- Build buffer for: new features, competition response, integration, debugging, usability testing, beta

**Feature Prioritization:**
- Forced cuts due to realistic schedules eliminate low-value features
- Without schedules, developers do easy/fun features first, important ones get delayed
- Excel 5 example: "deferred" features were actually worthless upon later review

## Bottom Line

Evidence-Based Scheduling uses historical velocity data and Monte Carlo simulation to generate realistic probability curves for ship dates, forcing better feature prioritization and preventing the chronic optimism that destroys software schedules.

# How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum

**Source:** https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/project-management-in-tech
**Section:** Project management

---

## Key Insights

**Big Tech Project Management Patterns:**
- Engineers lead 90%+ of projects (no dedicated team-level PMs)
- Teams choose their own methodology - RFC planning + iterative building/shipping
- Technical Program Manager ratio: ~1:50 engineers (only for multi-team projects)
- First-class dev tooling enables daily shipping vs quarterly releases

**Survey Findings (100+ companies):**
- Teams with dedicated PMs show lower satisfaction at tech companies
- Team autonomy correlates with high satisfaction (4-5/5 ratings)
- JIRA has Net Promoter Score of -83 at high-growth tech companies
- Engineers excluded from estimation = top demotivator and retention risk

**Scrum Works When:**
- "Kitchen sink teams" need stakeholder management structure
- New teams in forming/storming phases need defined processes
- Shipping cadence <monthly needs acceleration to 2-4 week cycles
- Organizations require unified progress reporting

**What Kills Project Success:**
- Requirements changing despite dedicated PMs
- No autonomy to modify failing processes
- Engineers not involved in commitments they're held to
- Optimizing for reporting over execution

**Organizational Structure Enablers:**
- Internal transparency (code, data, metrics access)
- Engineer-to-business exposure vs triangular communication
- Cross-functional teams of 5-15 people with clear ownership
- Platform teams handle 30-40% of engineering (reduce dev friction)

**Decision Speed Formula:**
- Fewer people in decision chain = faster execution
- Engineer-to-engineer communication > PM intermediaries
- Rotating project lead roles among engineers builds leadership

## Bottom Line
High-performing tech companies optimize for team autonomy and minimal process overhead rather than standardized methodologies, but this only works with competent people, strong tooling, and organizational trust.

# How to Scope a New Feature

**Source:** https://www.prodify.group/blog/how-to-scope-a-new-feature
**Section:** Project management

---

## Key Insights

**3-Phase Release Framework (Alpha → Beta → GA)**
- Alpha: Test core assumption with 5-8 manual reviews, measure 15% download rate lift
- Beta: Scale to 20-30 reviews via automation, maintain performance with <3% user participation rate
- GA: Roll out to all users after proving concept and scaling mechanism

**Planning Phase Essentials**
- Draft internal press release before building (forces clarity on customer value)
- Pre-identify specific Alpha/Beta/GA customers with sales team
- Document both customer success metrics AND business metrics upfront
- Determine pricing strategy with revenue projections before development

**Cross-Functional Ownership Map**
- Product: Goals, metrics, customer research, UX breakdown
- Engineering: Architecture design, build/test cycles, demo environment
- Design: UX progression across phases, feedback incorporation
- Sales/CS: Customer identification, documentation, enablement content

**Post-Launch Process**
- Mandatory retrospective with all teams (Product, Engineering, Design, CS, Marketing, Sales)
- Document whether feature met both customer AND business goals
- Review lessons learned for future features

**Concrete Example Metrics**
- Target: 4.5+ star average from specific review counts per phase
- Success threshold: 15-20% lift in download rate KPI
- Beta participation benchmark: 3% of users write reviews

## Bottom Line

Use a structured 3-phase release process with pre-defined exit criteria, cross-functional ownership, and mandatory retrospectives to ensure features deliver measurable business value before full investment.

# Measuring an engineering organization

**Source:** https://lethain.com/measuring-engineering-organizations/
**Section:** Project management

---

## Key Insights

**Four Measurement Categories for Self:**
- **Plan**: Track shipped projects by team + business impact to support project selection/prioritization
- **Operate**: Monitor incidents (with reviews), downtime minutes, API latency, engineering cost per business metric, app store ratings, onboarding conversion
- **Optimize**: Use SPACE framework or developer productivity surveys to understand system feedback loops
- **Inspire**: Maintain list of technical investments that transformed "impossible" into "obvious" for annual planning cycles

**Four Stakeholder Categories:**
- **CEO/Board**: Reuse planning/operational metrics; avoid optimization metrics (efficiency ≠ impact to non-engineers)
- **Finance**: Track headcount vs budget, vendor costs vs budget, capitalization justification; document engineering allocation across business units
- **Strategic Peers** (Product/Design/Sales): Use same planning metrics for alignment
- **Tactical Peers** (Customer Success/Legal): Agree on concrete numbers they can be accountable for

**Sequencing Rules:**
- Only measure difficult things if you'll actually use the data for decisions
- Measure easy things to build stakeholder trust, even if imperfect
- Take on only one new measurement at a time

**Key Anti-patterns:**
- Using measurement to solve trust issues (address root frustration instead)
- Perfectionism preventing any measurement
- Using optimization metrics to judge individual/team performance
- Measuring individuals instead of teams

**Data Validation Process:**
- Review weekly with month/quarter/year trends
- Maintain hypothesis for data changes; investigate violations
- Segment data to capture distinct experiences (geography, tech stack)
- Compare objective metrics with subjective team experience

## Bottom Line
Start measuring for your own operational needs first, then layer on stakeholder requirements one at a time, focusing on building trust through consistent reporting rather than perfect metrics.

# What TPMs Do and What Software Engineers Can Learn From Them

**Source:** https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-tpms-do
**Section:** Project management

---

## Key Insights

**TPM Value Proposition:**
- TPMs are "force multipliers on a different level" - can make difference between 6-month smooth delivery vs 2-year departmental chokeup
- DoorDash ratio: 15 TPMs for ~1,000 tech people; Uber: 70 TPMs for 4,000 tech org
- TPMs own "when?" and "who?" questions while PMs own "why/what?" and EMs own "how?"

**Core TPM Responsibilities:**
- Lead complex, multi-team projects (GDPR implementation, mobile app rewrites)
- Own engineering programs that aren't products (cloud migrations, tech debt)
- Drive engineering delivery for domains (mobile, frontend, infrastructure)
- Manage engineering brand, strategy, and top-level OKRs
- Handle engineering processes (release management, incident response)

**TPM Career Paths:**
- No single path - "uncommon" backgrounds are common
- Easier to transition internally at current company than externally
- Common transitions: project managers, EMs, business program managers, software engineers, product managers

**Working Effectively with TPMs:**
- Treat as partnership, not project management
- Invest time getting TPMs up to speed on technology and constraints
- TPMs should understand engineering reality to push in right areas
- Best for projects with multiple teams, not single-team efforts

**Key TPM Skills Engineers Can Learn:**
- Cross-organizational influence and communication
- Managing up to directors/VPs level
- Breadth perspective across organization
- Leading cross-team projects and conflict resolution

## Bottom Line
TPMs are specialized force multipliers who coordinate complex, multi-team engineering initiatives, and their core skills around cross-organizational influence and project orchestration are increasingly valuable for senior engineers.

# Development process

# A successful Git branching model

**Source:** https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights

**Context-dependent applicability:**
- Git-flow designed for explicitly versioned software requiring multiple version support
- For continuous delivery web apps, use simpler workflows like GitHub flow instead
- Author explicitly warns against treating this as dogma after 10+ years

**Core branch structure:**
- Two infinite lifetime branches: `master` (production-ready) and `develop` (integration)
- Three supporting branch types with limited lifetimes: feature, release, hotfix
- Every commit to `master` = new production release by definition

**Feature branch rules:**
- Branch from: `develop`
- Merge to: `develop` 
- Use `--no-ff` flag to preserve feature history and enable easy rollbacks
- Exist only in developer repos, not origin

**Release branch workflow:**
- Branch from `develop` when ready for release
- Version number assigned at branch creation, not earlier
- Allows minor bug fixes and metadata preparation
- Must merge back to both `master` (tagged) and `develop`

**Hotfix branch process:**
- Branch from `master` for critical production fixes
- Merge back to both `master` and `develop` (or current release branch)
- Enables parallel work while fixing production issues

**Key technical details:**
- Always use `--no-ff` for merges to maintain branch history
- Tag all releases on `master` for future reference
- Central "truth" repo called `origin` despite Git's decentralized nature

## Bottom Line
Git-flow is a comprehensive branching model for versioned software requiring structured releases, but teams should choose simpler workflows for continuous delivery scenarios.

---

# Comparing Git workflows

**Source:** https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights

**Workflow Selection Criteria:**
- Scale with team size
- Easy error recovery/rollback capability  
- Minimal cognitive overhead for developers

**Centralized Workflow Mechanics:**
- Single `main` branch, no feature branches
- Developers clone central repo, commit locally, push when ready
- Use `git pull --rebase origin main` to avoid merge commits
- Best for: SVN migrations, small teams (scalability bottleneck with conflicts)

**Conflict Resolution Process:**
- `git pull --rebase` moves local commits to tip after syncing
- Resolves conflicts commit-by-commit vs. one massive merge
- `git rebase --abort` to escape if confused
- `git rebase --continue` after resolving each conflict

**Branch Strategy Guidelines:**
- Short-lived branches reduce merge conflicts and deployment risks
- Design workflow to prevent reverts proactively
- Match release schedule: frequent releases = stable main branch; infrequent = use tags
- Align branches with task tracking systems

**Alternative Workflows:**
- **Feature Branching**: Dedicated branch per feature, keeps main stable
- **Gitflow**: Strict branching model with specific branch roles for releases
- **Forking**: Each developer has server-side + local repo (vs. shared central)

**Implementation Commands:**
- `git init --bare` for central repo setup
- `git clone ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git`
- `git pull --rebase origin main` (preferred over merge)

## Bottom Line
Choose Git workflows based on team size, release frequency, and error tolerance rather than technical complexity—centralized works for small teams but bottlenecks with scale.

# How to Write a Postmortem

**Source:** https://web.archive.org/web/20210618014202/https://blog.serverdensity.com/how-to-write-a-postmortem/
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights

**Timing & Process**
- Wait 1 week between incident resolution and full postmortem publication to rule out follow-up incidents and gather all stakeholder input
- Publish short status updates during crisis at regular intervals, even if just "still investigating"
- Start with internal Jira incident page, then filter security details for public status page

**Content Structure Requirements**
- Root cause analysis (may trace back months before outage)
- Timeline of identification/isolation steps and duration
- Impact scope (who/what services affected)
- Resolution steps taken
- Lessons learned with specific process/product/strategy changes

**Ownership Model**
- Status updates: whoever leads incident response or is on-call (ops/support)
- Internal postmortem draft: same incident responders
- Public postmortem: CEO publishes after internal review complete

**Focus Management**
- Use postmortems to shift from "urgent/important" (outage response) back to "important/not urgent" work
- Prevents getting stuck in reactive quadrants 3-4 of Eisenhower Matrix

**Transparency Benefits**
- Over-communication restores customer confidence
- Public accountability creates incentives to fix problems
- Demonstrates investment and care to technical audiences

## Bottom Line
Wait a week post-incident, have responders draft internally with CEO publishing publicly, and treat postmortems as mandatory learning tools that shift focus from reactive firefighting back to strategic work.

# Startup Lessons Learned - Five Whys

**Source:** http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights
- Five Whys process: For each problem, ask "why" 5 times to reach root cause, then implement proportional fixes at each level
- Most technical problems trace back to human/process issues - bias toward technical solutions misses real causes
- Start with one team, one problem class, assign a "Five Whys master" to run post-mortems with all involved parties
- Email analysis company-wide in plain English - forces clear thinking and builds organizational learning
- Make investments proportional to problem severity - don't over-invest in small issues or under-invest in major ones
- Pareto principle built-in: recurring problems automatically focus effort on the 20% causing 80% of waste
- IMVU's 5-layer defense system evolved incrementally through Five Whys:
  - Individual sandboxes mimicking production
  - Comprehensive test suite with TDD
  - 100% CI on every checkin
  - Automated incremental deployment with health monitoring
  - Dynamic alerting based on historical patterns vs static thresholds
- Enabled dozens of daily production deployments without significant downtime
- Works with legacy code - team had "tens of thousands of lines" with no test coverage when starting
- Typical outcome: Engineer productivity on day one, investments in previously hard-to-justify improvements

## Bottom Line
Five Whys systematically converts recurring technical crises into incremental process improvements by tracing problems to their human/organizational root causes and making proportional investments in prevention.

# Testing in Production, the safe way

**Source:** https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-safe-way-18ca102d0ef1
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights

**Three Phases of Production**
- **Deploy**: Code runs in production but serves no user traffic. Enables zero-risk installation and testing against real production environment
- **Release**: Traffic gradually shifts to new version via canaries, monitoring error rates/latency for automated rollback
- **Post-release**: Live system verification through feature flags, A/B tests, chaos engineering

**Deploy Phase Testing**
- Integration testing in production using service discovery tags to isolate deployed vs released versions
- Test against production databases with whitelisted test accounts or mark test data with metadata flags
- **Shadowing**: Replay 100% production traffic against new service in fire-and-forget mode (works best for stateless services)
- **Tap-compare**: Run requests against both old/new versions, compare responses for correctness
- Load testing via traffic shifting - redirect production traffic to smaller clusters to find capacity limits

**Release Phase Practices**
- Monitor only 3-7 core metrics: error rate, request rate, latency (99th percentile)
- Automated canary rollback based on baseline comparison thresholds
- Traffic shaping: gradually shift from 1% → 100% production traffic over weeks

**Service Mesh Benefits**
- Sidecar proxies can inject test headers (X-ServiceB-Test) to signal upstream services
- Enables network-level contract testing without code changes

**Configuration Testing**
- Treat config pushes with same rigor as code deploys
- Use sticky canaries: deploy config to 1% users hitting small server subset first
- Static validation + programmatic checks for config files

**Chaos Engineering Prerequisites**
- Requires operational sophistication and established resilience baseline
- Treat as scientific discipline with precise experiments to identify hidden vulnerabilities

## Bottom Line
Testing in production requires fundamental system design changes but enables verification against real traffic patterns and environment conditions that staging environments cannot replicate.

---

# Trunk Based Development

**Source:** https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights

- **Core practice**: Developers merge small, frequent updates to main branch (trunk) rather than long-lived feature branches
- **Required for CI/CD**: Trunk-based development is mandatory for true continuous integration - automated builds/tests can't work effectively with isolated, lengthy feature branches
- **Daily merge requirement**: High-performing teams merge branches to trunk at least once daily to maintain release cadence
- **3-branch rule**: Keep maximum of 3 active branches in repository; delete branches immediately after merging
- **Small batch commits**: Keep changes to few lines of code/commits to minimize cognitive overhead and enable rapid decision-making
- **Feature flags over branches**: Wrap new features in inactive code paths on main branch rather than creating separate feature branches
- **Automated testing stack**: Unit/integration tests run on merge; full end-to-end tests run in later pipeline stages
- **Immediate code review**: Review code synchronously, not asynchronously - use automated test results as first-pass validation
- **Green trunk assumption**: Main branch must always be stable and deploy-ready at any commit
- **Build optimization**: Use caching layers and optimized test stubs to maintain fast execution times
- **Eliminates code freezes**: Properly implemented trunk-based development removes need for planned integration phases

## Bottom Line
Trunk-based development enables high-performing teams to deploy daily by forcing small, frequent merges with automated testing, while traditional long-lived branches create integration complexity that breaks CI/CD.

# Why You Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love Technical Debt

**Source:** https://marker.medium.com/why-you-should-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love-technical-debt-55bb5684f94c
**Section:** Development process

---

## Key Insights
- Technical debt is borrowing against future development velocity to ship features faster today
- Like financial debt, technical debt has interest payments: slower development, more bugs, harder onboarding
- Key difference: technical debt's "interest rate" is variable and unpredictable, unlike fixed financial debt
- Most teams accumulate technical debt unconsciously without tracking the "loan terms"
- Organizational debt follows same pattern: quick fixes to process/structure that create long-term friction
- Strategic technical debt can be valuable when:
  - You need to test market hypotheses quickly
  - The borrowed time helps you reach next funding milestone
  - The feature enables learning that changes your technical direction
- Track technical debt like financial debt: document what you borrowed, expected payback timeline, actual impact on velocity
- Set explicit "credit limits" - maximum technical debt before mandatory paydown period
- Different types have different interest rates: infrastructure debt compounds faster than UI debt

## Bottom Line
Technical debt becomes a strategic tool when you consciously choose to borrow development time with clear repayment plans, rather than accidentally accumulating it.

# Architecture

# 10 Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes

**Source:** https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

**Business Reality**
- Business requirements only diverge, never converge - in 15 years, author has never seen requirements stabilize
- Plan for 100 things, business will demand the 101st; solve 1,000 problems, they'll create 10,000 more

**Architecture Patterns**
- Vertically split business functionality before horizontal splitting - isolate actions rather than combining them
- Example: User profile system started as shared CRUD, ended with 13 different signup flows with no meaningful shared logic
- Duplication is better than wrong abstraction - only expose shared abstractions after seeing multiple similar use cases

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- Generic everything: Generic Adapters, Query builders, Request handlers, etc. - perfect abstractions come with expiry dates
- Shallow wrappers: 1:1 library mirrors that require changes everywhere when underlying library changes
- Sandwich layers: Splitting cohesive actions into 10-20 meaningless layers for "testability"
- Tool-like quality application: Making everything "private final" or interfaces for all classes doesn't improve code

**Specific Examples**
- Enterprise FizzBuzz follows SOLID principles perfectly but takes gazillions of lines to print "Fizz Buzz"
- CMS built for "extensibility" - business people never used it, always needed developers anyway
- Magic database configurability file failed when client wanted to switch only half the models

**Estimation Impact**
- Bad estimation destroys quality before code is written - smart developers overestimate capability and take ugly shortcuts

**System Health**
- Healthy systems churn constantly - areas without commits for long periods are code smells
- Refactoring must be part of every story, no code is untouchable

## Bottom Line
Business requirements always diverge and perfect abstractions expire, so prioritize code that's easy to delete over code that's easy to extend.

# Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API

**Source:** https://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

**API Design Principles:**
- API is a developer UI - prioritize pleasant experience over academic REST purity
- Use plural nouns for all endpoints (/tickets not /ticket) to avoid pluralization complexity
- Relations: nest dependent resources (/tickets/12/messages), use identifiers for independent relations

**Technical Standards:**
- SSL everywhere, no exceptions - throw hard errors on non-SSL requests, never redirect
- Version in URL (v1) not headers for browser explorability
- JSON only - XML adds verbosity with no real benefit
- snake_case is 20% easier to read than camelCase according to eye-tracking studies

**Query Parameters Framework:**
- Filtering: `?state=open`
- Sorting: `?sort=-priority,created_at` (minus = descending)
- Field limiting: `?fields=id,subject,updated_at`
- Embedding: `?embed=customer.name,assigned_user`

**Response Standards:**
- Pretty print by default - only 0.6% overhead with gzip (which saves 60%)
- Return full resource representation on POST/PUT/PATCH
- No envelopes by default unless JSONP (?envelope=true) or limited HTTP clients

**Pagination & Rate Limiting:**
- Use Link header for pagination (RFC 8288), not envelope data
- Rate limit headers: X-Rate-Limit-Limit, X-Rate-Limit-Remaining, X-Rate-Limit-Reset (seconds remaining, not timestamp)

**Authentication & Caching:**
- Token-based auth over HTTP Basic Auth (stateless)
- Use ETag or Last-Modified headers for HTTP caching
- Support method override via X-HTTP-Method-Override header for limited clients

**Error Handling:**
- Structured JSON errors with code, message, description
- Validation errors: top-level code + detailed errors array with field-specific codes

## Bottom Line
Design APIs as developer UIs with pragmatic choices over academic purity - use consistent patterns, clear documentation, and leverage HTTP standards while prioritizing ease of use and browser explorability.

# Design patterns for microservices

**Source:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/design-patterns-for-microservices/
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

**Communication Patterns:**
- **Gateway Aggregation**: Combine multiple microservice calls into single request to reduce network chattiness
- **Backends for Frontends**: Create separate backend services per client type (desktop/mobile) to avoid conflicting requirements in single service
- **Gateway Routing**: Use single endpoint to route to multiple microservices, eliminating client endpoint management

**Resilience Patterns:**
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources (connection pools, memory, CPU) per service to prevent resource starvation and cascading failures
- **Ambassador**: Offload common connectivity tasks (monitoring, logging, routing, TLS) in language-agnostic way

**Migration Patterns:**
- **Anti-corruption Layer**: Implement façade between new and legacy systems to prevent legacy dependencies from limiting new application design
- **Strangler**: Replace legacy functionality incrementally with new services rather than big-bang migration

**Deployment Patterns:**
- **Sidecar**: Deploy helper components as separate containers/processes for isolation and encapsulation
- **Gateway Offloading**: Move shared functionality (SSL certificates) to API gateway instead of duplicating across services

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Each pattern addresses specific microservices challenges while maintaining service autonomy
- Patterns can be combined within single architecture
- Focus on increasing deployment velocity through service decomposition

## Bottom Line
These 9 patterns provide concrete solutions for common microservices challenges around communication, resilience, migration, and deployment while preserving the core benefit of independent service deployment.

# How I Write Tests

**Source:** https://blog.nelhage.com/2016/12/how-i-test/
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

- Work module-at-a-time: Design units testable with minimal dependencies, complete both module and tests before moving to next component
- Avoid manual testing urge: When tempted to run binary by hand, pause and write automated test instead - manual tests only verify current state, automated tests remain valid indefinitely
- Write reusable "fakes": Standalone implementations of component interfaces (e.g., in-memory S3, email outbox) that work across multiple tests vs ad-hoc stubbing
- Design miniformats for test data: Create human-readable textual representations of domain objects/inputs to avoid constructing complex objects in code repeatedly
- Build testing "zoos": Data-driven test harnesses where new test cases = adding data files in familiar format, no additional code (inspired by GCC's `{dg-*}` directive system)
- HTTP proxy example: Pasted entire HTTP requests/responses into files for automated replay testing by stubbing entropy and using standard initial database state
- Regression test everything: Every bug found (even mid-development typos you catch yourself) should become a test to create ratchet effect on bug types
- Testing tools investment: If testing in code is hard/frustrating, build tooling to make it easier - tests are important codebase features

## Bottom Line
Invest heavily in testing infrastructure and treat every bug as a permanent test case to create a ratchet effect that prevents regression while making future testing easier.

# Microservices – Please, don’t

**Source:** https://riak.com/posts/technical/microservices-please-dont/
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

- **Domain understanding is prerequisite**: Only consider microservices when you deeply understand your domain boundaries, dependencies, and request workflows. If still figuring out the domain, microservices cause more harm than good.

- **Network calls are slower than in-process**: Performance gains from microservices are often due to new language/tech stack, not the architecture. Network latency always exceeds co-resident code calls.

- **Start with internal service modules**: Build cleanly defined modules in monolithic code first, then extract to separate services only when true need arises over time.

- **Distributed transactions add complexity**: Cross-service data operations require handling multiple failure modes (application + network level) and coordinating recovery strategies for each.

- **Scaling works equally for monoliths**: You can create logical clusters of monolithic apps (API servers, dashboards, background jobs) and scale them independently - same benefit as microservices.

- **Local development overhead**: Running multiple services locally requires maintaining Docker configs and complex test setups as the system grows.

- **Team coordination friction**: Bugs spanning services require multiple team synchronization. Engineers in isolated codebases develop "not my problem" syndrome vs. shared codebase collaboration.

- **Monitoring becomes critical**: Need comprehensive data across all services to debug performance issues and errors in distributed systems.

- **Business value justification required**: Delaying revenue-generating features for architectural changes needs clear ROI demonstration to business stakeholders.

## Bottom Line

Microservices solve organizational problems, not technical ones - start with well-designed internal service modules in a monolith and only extract when you have deep domain knowledge and demonstrable business need.

# Shrinking microservices to functions

**Source:** https://highscalability.com/blog/2017/3/27/faster-networks-cheaper-messages-microservices-functions-edg.html
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

**Network/Messaging Evolution Enables Architectural Shifts:**
- Network speeds increased 25x (1 gbps → 25 gbps) while message formats (Avro, gRPC vs XML) became 100x more efficient
- Combined effect: 100-1000x improvement in inter-service communication efficiency
- This enables breaking monoliths into 100+ microservices within latency bounds

**Five Deployment Evolution Phases:**
- Phase 1: Manual 6-month releases
- Phase 2: Agile 2-week cycles with Chef/Puppet
- Phase 3: Cloud APIs + Blue-Green deploys (immutable infrastructure)
- Phase 4: Container standardization (seconds deployment, predictable components)
- Phase 5: Serverless (100ms deployment, pay-per-100ms usage)

**Serverless Economics:**
- Memory usage drops significantly—unused functions in monoliths/microservices still consume memory
- Hackathon teams built production-ready systems in 12 hours using Lambda
- Rewriting from scratch often faster than migration

**Edge Computing Challenge:**
- Edge violates Lambda's core assumptions: scalable backend services + low latency messaging
- High latency back to datacenter creates architectural tension
- Solution unclear—may require fundamentally different approaches

**Organizational Design (Inverse Conway Maneuver):**
- Structure teams to match desired architecture
- Two Pizza teams with full microservice ownership within single timezone
- High trust within teams, low trust interfaces (APIs/SLAs) between teams
- Scattered global teams produce distributed monoliths

**AWS Lock-in Strategy:**
- Build fast, don't worry about vendor lock-in
- If Lambda app takes 1 week to build, migration also takes ~1 week
- Business logic easily portable, focus on replacement speed over reuse

## Bottom Line
The same technology forces (faster networks + cheaper messaging) that enabled microservices are now enabling functions, with edge computing as the next frontier requiring new architectural paradigms.

# The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018

**Source:** https://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/
**Section:** Architecture

---

## Key Insights

- Microservices create 3x complexity explosion: developers must run multiple services locally, operators manage hundreds vs. few services, devops teams need container orchestration expertise
- Poor boundary definition kills independence: services that look separate on paper often have hidden dependencies, requiring coordinated deployments of service groups
- State management destroys stateless benefits: schema changes in databases affect multiple services simultaneously, forcing synchronized rollouts and rollback cascades
- Communication complexity scales exponentially: network calls multiply failure points, requiring retry logic and asynchronous patterns that reintroduce distributed state problems
- Versioning becomes dependency hell: tracking which service versions work together becomes unmanageable, similar to node modules conflicts but with live services
- Distributed transactions are painful: ACID properties across microservices require complex orchestration or accepting eventual consistency
- Orchestration platforms are monoliths in disguise: Kubernetes clusters become single points of failure requiring their own complex management
- Networking complexity follows Tesler's Law: virtual networking, load balancing, and DNS complexity gets hidden but resurfaces during runtime issues

**Decision Framework Questions:**
- Can your team actually operate distributed systems?
- Are your domain boundaries truly independent?
- Do you need distributed transactions?
- Can you handle eventual consistency?
- Do you have container orchestration expertise?

## Bottom Line

Microservices trade development complexity for operational complexity - only worth it if you have serious distributed systems expertise and truly independent domain boundaries.

# Technologies

# Big-O explained in plain English

**Source:** https://stackoverflow.com/a/487278/472433
**Section:** Technologies

---

## Key Insights

- **Big O measures worst-case scaling**: O(n) means doubling input roughly doubles time; O(n²) means 100x input = 10,000x time
- **Only the dominant term matters**: O(n² + 2n) simplifies to O(n²) because n² dwarfs 2n at scale
- **Common complexities ranked by performance**:
  - O(1): Constant - same time regardless of input size
  - O(log n): Logarithmic - 1M items takes ~20 operations (binary search)
  - O(n): Linear - time scales 1:1 with input
  - O(n log n): Common for good sorting algorithms
  - O(n²): Quadratic - nested loops, bubble sort
  - O(2^n): Exponential - becomes unusable quickly
  - O(n!): Factorial - traveling salesman brute force

- **Practical scaling examples**:
  - Phone book lookup: O(log n) via binary search vs O(n) for reverse lookup
  - Multiplication: O(n²) operations for n-digit numbers
  - Hash table lookup: O(1) average case enables O(n) solutions instead of O(n²)

- **Data structures enable better complexity**: Preprocessing with hash tables/trees trades O(n) setup cost for O(1) or O(log n) queries
- **Constant factors ignored**: 2n² and 100n² are both O(n²) - focus is on growth pattern, not absolute speed
- **Multiple variables matter**: String search is O(text_length + query_length), not just O(n)

## Bottom Line
Big O describes how algorithm performance scales with input size, helping you choose approaches that remain viable as data grows rather than becoming impossibly slow.

# CAP Theorem: Revisited

**Source:** https://robertgreiner.com/cap-theorem-revisited/
**Section:** Technologies

---

## Key Insights
- Networks are unreliable by default - network failures happen frequently and unexpectedly, making partition tolerance mandatory in distributed systems
- CAP theorem forces binary choice: CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance) vs AP (Availability + Partition tolerance) - you cannot avoid choosing
- CP systems: Return timeouts/errors during partitions, choose when business requires atomic reads/writes
- AP systems: Return potentially stale data during partitions, accept writes for later processing, choose when business tolerates eventual consistency
- Network partitions are external factors beyond software control; response to partitions is a deliberate software design decision
- Object-oriented programming assumptions (shared memory, reliability) break down completely in network programming
- The consistency/availability tradeoff must be decided at architecture phase - getting it wrong can doom the application before first deployment

## Bottom Line
CAP theorem in practice means choosing between returning errors during network failures (CP) or returning stale data (AP), since partition tolerance is mandatory in any real distributed system.

# Microsoft Azure in Plain English

**Source:** https://web.archive.org/web/20190508145128/https://www.expeditedssl.com/azure-in-plain-english
**Section:** Technologies

---

## Key Insights

**Service Naming/Positioning Patterns:**
- Azure renames core concepts: Web Apps = PaaS, Cloud Services = IaaS, Virtual Machines = traditional servers
- Many services are direct AWS competitors with confusing names (Service Fabric vs Lambda, Table Storage vs DynamoDB)

**Web/App Development Stack:**
- Service Fabric = microservices platform (AWS Lambda equivalent)
- App Service Web Apps = PaaS hosting (Heroku-like)
- Application Insights = APM for .NET/Java apps
- Visual Studio Team Services = integrated CI/CD + source control

**Storage Architecture:**
- Single "Storage" service encompasses: Blob (S3-like), Table (NoSQL), Queue (SQS-like), File (EBS-like)
- StorSimple adds automated tiering between local/cloud storage
- Redis Cache positioned as Memcached replacement

**Enterprise Integration:**
- BizTalk connects enterprise apps (SAP, PeopleSoft)
- Service Bus = enterprise message queuing
- Active Directory can sync with on-premise AD or replace entirely
- RemoteApp = Citrix-like app virtualization

**Big Data Pipeline:**
- Data Lake Store = Hadoop ETL processing
- Data Factory = scheduled data movement pipeline
- Stream Analytics = real-time analytics processing (Kinesis equivalent)
- HDInsight = managed Apache ecosystem (Pig, Hive, HBase, Storm, Spark)

**Mobile Backend Services:**
- Mobile Apps = full BaaS with auth, push, data storage
- Notification Hubs supports iOS, Android, Windows, Kindle push notifications

## Bottom Line
Azure mirrors AWS services but with Microsoft-centric naming and tighter Windows/Office integration, requiring translation between marketing names and actual functions.

# SaaS CTO Security Checklist

**Source:** https://web.archive.org/web/20230324072622/https://www.goldfiglabs.com/guide/saas-cto-security-checklist/
**Section:** Technologies

---

## Key Insights

**Employee Security**
- Require 2FA universally - passwords alone insufficient protection
- Hardware-based 2FA (Yubikeys) more secure than phone-based
- Computer locking prevents physical access exploitation in <5 minutes
- Never share user accounts - prevents access tracking and compromises offboarding
- Encrypt all laptops/phones with remote wipe capability
- Use centralized account management with SSO to automate provisioning/deprovisioning
- Hire first security engineer only when engineering team bought-in but overwhelmed

**Code Security**  
- Never commit secrets to code - use separate secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Never build custom cryptography - use established libraries like NaCl
- Integrate SAST tools in CI/CD but expect high false positive rates
- Run team security testing sessions targeting account isolation, token uniqueness, unauthenticated paths
- Automate security scanning in SDLC to avoid velocity impact

**Application Security**
- WAFs outdated - use Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) closer to application
- Track all dependencies for known vulnerabilities (major OWASP risk)
- Run applications unprivileged to limit attack impact
- FaaS requires centralized code repos, minimal privileges, CI deployment

**Infrastructure Security**
- Test backup restoration frequently - backup without restore verification is useless
- Enable automatic container image security scanning with dashboard alerts
- Monitor network for unexpected exposed services using scanners
- Isolate internal services behind bastion hosts/VPNs with IP restrictions
- Watch metrics for unusual patterns indicating compromise (bandwidth, CPU, memory)

**Company Security**
- Create asset inventory - can't secure what you don't know exists
- Separate guest WiFi, rotate password every 2 months
- Domain protection: transfer locks, different domain for admin email, security-focused registrar
- Bug bounty programs require internal security expertise to evaluate reports

## Bottom Line
Security scales through automation and cultural integration rather than adding more manual processes that slow development velocity.

# A reference guide for fintech & small-data engineering

**Source:** https://medium.com/dangerous-engineering/a-reference-guide-for-fintech-small-data-engineering-bd65b9796d90
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Three Engineering Levels:**
- Code level: Individual methods/functions (features made here)
- Application level: Whole applications with complex business logic (products made here)  
- System level: Multiple applications across environments (companies made here)

**System-Level Work Rules:**
- Only two permitted activities: bring system in line with design OR design replacement system
- Everything else is busywork
- Senior engineers are primarily engineering designers, not just implementors

**Small-Data Company Characteristics:**
- Production dataset <1TB (fits on two iPhones)
- Focus domain model correctness over computational efficiency
- Encrypt data by default everywhere except product memory
- Separate data by sensitivity (PHI, PII, PCI)

**Technology Selection Rule:**
"If a problem is unique to your product offering then you may invent an appropriate solution. Otherwise go with an industry standard approach — and only use one approach at a time."

**Five-Stage Migration Process:**
1. Design v2 and path to get there
2. Fix v1 (most teams skip this)
3. Implement v2
4. Migrate v1→v2 in atomic steps
5. Delete v1 (most teams skip this)

**Security Principle:**
Simplicity, correctness, security, scalability, and maintainability are neighbors - when far from one, you're far from all.

**Service Extraction:**
- Extract verbs, not nouns
- Cannot extract "User" service - extract "UserApproval" operations instead
- Fix data dependencies first before extracting

**Investment Model Balance:**
- Startup: 100% value creation
- Product-market fit: Lose 1 year value creation to gain 1 year cost reduction
- Ecological dominance phase: Nearly 100% cost reduction until massive moat built

**Engineering Standards:**
- Never do work below your best quality
- Put maximum effort into naming
- No TODOs without tracked tickets
- Never fix bugs without fixing underlying design flaw
- Make data migrations as freely as code changes

## Bottom Line
Small-data companies with complex domains need engineers focused on system-level design and domain modeling correctness rather than computational efficiency, with security and simplicity as the primary architectural constraints.

# Building a data science team

**Source:** https://fastdatascience.com/building-a-data-science-team/
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights
- Start with 3 separate teams: data science (ML algorithms), data engineering (pipelines/scale), and operations (infrastructure)
- **Hire data engineer first, not data scientist** - engineers build necessary infrastructure; data scientists from academia lack programming/engineering skills
- Data scientists hired without proper infrastructure quit within 6 months due to lack of data access
- Data science teams need high organizational placement (report to CTO/CEO/CDO) to get cross-departmental cooperation
- Don't impose software development practices on data science - it's experimental research, not predictable task completion
- Avoid KPI-based bonuses tied to model accuracy - creates wrong incentives
- Multiple competing data science teams in same organization leads to turf wars
- Business domain expertise bottlenecks (e.g., medical professionals for labeling) require management leverage to access
- Data science projects need direct communication lines to business stakeholders, not filtered through intermediaries
- Academic credentials (PhD, Ivy League) less important than STEM background + practical skills
- Common failure: treating data science as extension of software development with strict deadlines

## Bottom Line
Build data infrastructure first with engineers, place the team high in org structure for political leverage, and manage it like experimental research rather than traditional software development.

# Building a data team at a mid-stage startup: a short story

**Source:** https://erikbern.com/2021/07/07/the-data-team-a-short-story.html
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Organizational Structure:**
- Embed data scientists into specific functional teams (marketing, product, supply chain) with centralized management but decentralized backlog
- Avoid central bottleneck by giving teams dedicated data resources while maintaining unified reporting structure
- Data scientists reporting to business leaders creates misalignment; they need managers who understand data

**Quick Wins Strategy:**
- Start with crude data warehouse (dump production tables hourly) to get all data in one place fast
- Open SQL access to business teams with basic training - eliminates "English-to-SQL translator" bottleneck  
- Focus on "data journalists" who find business insights over ML researchers initially
- Build demos/prototypes (like Flask app) to make ML work tangible for product teams

**Common Mid-Stage Startup Problems:**
- Fragmented data across systems, poor instrumentation
- Data scientists doing R&D with no clear business goals
- Product teams celebrating shipping over measurable outcomes
- Business analysts building "shadow tech debt" (500-line SQL queries, complex spreadsheets)
- Teams hiring around dysfunctional data org

**Success Metrics:**
- CEO pushing for data-driven decisions from top
- Product managers justifying projects with test results/data insights
- Teams tracking end-to-end metrics (customer acquisition cost vs cost-per-click)
- Failed experiments generating learnings, not blame

**Hiring Profile:**
- Emphasize software skills + business empathy over AI/ML credentials
- Look for generalists who can build practical solutions

## Bottom Line

Transform from isolated ML research team to embedded business partners by centralizing data infrastructure fast, embedding data scientists in functional teams, and focusing on practical insights over sophisticated models until the organization becomes truly data-native.

# Database Migrations Done Right

**Source:** https://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2014/05/06/database-migrations-done-right/
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights
- Never tie database migrations to application deploys - treat as separate, independent operations
- Break schema changes into 5-step backward-compatible sequence: add nullable column → update app code → migrate data → add constraint → remove null-handling code
- Every database change must be backward compatible with existing system state
- Example: Adding non-null column requires 2 months if deploying weekly/fortnightly vs 2 days if deploying hourly/daily
- Use database migration tools (like DBDeploy) for reliable, repeatable script execution
- Avoid ORMs that inseparably combine schema and code changes
- Small, frequent releases enable faster feedback loops and higher throughput
- Rolling deployments become possible when migrations are decoupled from app deploys
- Pattern works even for greenfield projects due to increased development throughput benefits
- Requires ability to work on small tasks and release changes to production quickly
- Scott Ambler's "Refactoring Databases" provides comprehensive patterns for breaking down changes

## Bottom Line
Decouple database migrations from application deployments by making every schema change backward compatible, enabling faster releases and rolling deployments.

# Databases in 2022: A Year in Review

**Source:** https://ottertune.com/blog/2022-databases-retrospective/
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Funding Reality Check:**
- Database funding dried up in H2 2022 after massive rounds in H1 ($110M+ rounds for Timescale, Voltron Data, Dbt Labs, Starburst)
- Gartner predicts 50% of independent DBMS vendors will fail by 2025
- Companies with billion-dollar valuations are too expensive for acquisition; major cloud providers already have competing offerings
- Survivors will likely be companies that enhance existing DBMSs rather than replace them

**Technical Developments:**
- Google AlloyDB: PostgreSQL with separated compute/storage, WAL processing in storage layer
- Snowflake Unistore: "Hybrid tables" for lower-latency transactions
- Oracle MySQL Heatwave: In-memory vectorized OLAP engine, now available on AWS
- Meta Velox: C++ execution engine (not full DBMS) for building other systems
- InfluxDB IOx: Complete rewrite using DataFusion/Apache Arrow, ditched MMAP

**Blockchain Assessment:**
- FTX (and other crypto exchanges) ran on PostgreSQL, not blockchain databases
- Blockchain transaction latencies: tens of seconds vs. milliseconds for traditional DBMSs
- AWS concluded in 2016 that blockchains were "solution looking for a problem"
- IBM's 2018 blockchain commercial marked technology's peak hype

**Industry Consolidation:**
- Execution frameworks (Velox, DataFusion, Polars) will commoditize OLAP capabilities within 5 years
- Key differentiators will shift to UI/UX and query optimization rather than raw performance
- All modern analytical DBMSs benefit from MonetDB research lineage (Snowflake, DuckDB ancestry)

## Bottom Line
The database industry faces a harsh consolidation period where half of independent vendors will likely fail by 2025, while technical differentiation shifts from performance to user experience as execution engines become commoditized.

# Evolutionary Database Design

**Source:** https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Core Process**
- Each database change must be captured as a migration script with sequential numbering, committed to version control alongside application code
- Never use schema editing tools for production changes - all alterations flow through migration scripts only
- Break large changes into smallest possible migrations - easier to debug, reverse, and compose together
- Track applied migrations via changelog table that migration tools update automatically

**Team Structure**
- DBAs must collaborate directly with developers, not through formal handoffs - sit together, use same communication channels, pair on complex changes
- Every developer gets their own database instance (separate schemas or VMs) to experiment freely without blocking others
- Database environments should be "phoenixes" - regularly destroyed and rebuilt to prevent drift

**Technical Architecture** 
- Database consists of both schema AND data - include standing/reference data and sample test data in version control
- All database changes are refactorings with 3 dimensions: schema change + data migration + application code update
- Use transition phases (views, triggers) for destructive changes in shared databases to support old and new access patterns simultaneously
- Separate all database access into clear layer using data source architectural patterns from P of EAA

**Automation & Integration**
- Developers integrate database changes daily via CI - pull mainline, resolve migration conflicts by renumbering, test, push
- Use tools like Flyway, Liquibase for automated migration application - same scripts run against dev, test, and production
- Migration conflicts resolved by renumbering sequence and testing against clean database
- Prefer real production data extracts over fictional test data from first iteration

**Scale Constraints**
- Proven on projects with 100+ people, 500+ tables, 24/7 uptime requirements
- Not yet solved: thousands of customized deployments, tens/hundreds of schemas per environment

## Bottom Line

Database schema evolution works at scale when every change is captured as a versioned migration script, developers get private database instances, and DBAs collaborate directly rather than gatekeep through formal processes.

# How to Structure a Data Science Team

**Source:** https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/how-to-structure-data-science-team-key-models-and-roles/
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Team Structure Models (by complexity/coordination level):**
- **Decentralized**: Analytics scattered across units - cheapest but creates silos, hiring/career path issues
- **Functional**: Analytics in one dept (marketing/supply) - good for analytics beginners, risks isolation
- **Consulting**: Central DS team serves all depts - works for SMBs with sporadic needs, poor data quality risk
- **Centralized**: One DS team serves whole org strategically - enables long-term projects but may disconnect from business
- **Center of Excellence (CoE)**: Central coordination + distributed analysts - most balanced for enterprises
- **Federated**: CoE + elite SWAT team for complex cross-functional tasks - handles both daily needs and innovation
- **Democratic**: Everyone gets BI tool access - can combine with any model above

**Key Role Distinctions:**
- **Type A (Analysis)**: Statisticians doing cleaning/forecasting/modeling - weak programming
- **Type B (Building)**: Engineers building production systems - strong programming + some stats
- **Salary benchmark**: US median $112,774 (2017)

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Start with MLaaS platforms (Google/Amazon/Microsoft/IBM) for "low hanging fruit"
- Hire STEM generalists initially, then specialists later
- Look for internal talent before external hiring
- One person can fulfill multiple roles in smaller teams

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Cultural shift to horizontal decision-making is hardest part
- Product managers need technical knowledge of DS vs software differences
- Embed data scientists in business units while reporting centrally
- Foster cross-functional collaboration from day one

## Bottom Line
Start with MLaaS and generalists, then evolve toward federated/CoE models as you scale, but the cultural shift to data-driven decision making is more critical than team structure.

# Managing Data Science Teams

**Source:** https://www.dominodatalab.com/resources/field-guide/managing-data-science-teams/
**Section:** Data

---

## Key Insights

**Hiring & Retention:**
- Hire senior leaders first - junior hires get lost without mentorship
- Replace take-home coding challenges with 1-hour in-person sessions with experienced data scientists
- Half of data scientists stay <2 years - reduce turnover by being realistic about role pain points upfront
- Break overwhelming projects into manageable chunks to prevent intimidation
- Create learning opportunities (weekly research lunches, hackathons) since boredom drives turnover

**Management Framework - 7 Habits:**
- Force data scientists to attend meetings without laptops to improve stakeholder communication
- Use templates to track 1-on-1 discussions, objectives, and feedback
- Train teams to deploy their own APIs to avoid engineering bottlenecks
- Implement weekly on-call rotation as teams scale to encourage better documentation
- New managers should stop coding for 3-6 months to fully embrace the role

**Knowledge Management System Requirements:**
- Must enable discovery, provenance, reuse, and modularity in one platform
- Only 20% of computational research code can be re-run successfully
- Organize around "models" as the unit of knowledge (includes data, code, parameters, results)
- Test discovery efficiency: time new hires finding artifacts (weeks/months = red flag)
- Test reuse: have new hire reproduce 6-month-old work (week+ duration = problem)

**Scaling Metrics:**
- Ask 5 data scientists separately how many projects the team is doing - different answers indicate coordination problems

## Bottom Line
Success requires hiring senior talent first, implementing systematic knowledge management around models as the core unit, and forcing better communication through process changes rather than relying on individual initiative.

# 85 Things I learned being a CEO

**Source:** https://hackernoon.com/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo-4c25fc1c7b99
**Section:** Startups

---

## Key Insights

**Decision Making & Strategy**
- Make decisions with 80% information max - speed beats perfection, course-correct later
- For strategic decisions: completely disconnect from operations, clear your mind, think only about future impact
- Wrong decisions 50%+ of the time is normal - detect mistakes early, never repeat them
- Some decisions can "significantly alter company direction" - don't rush these, let serendipity happen

**Cash Management & Fundraising**
- Track 4 metrics monthly: cash outflow, revenue collected, salary spend, bank balance
- Raise money in good times, not when you need it - raise maximum possible amount
- Practice pitch constantly to deliver anywhere, anytime
- Friendly terms > extra money (accept $500K less for better terms)

**People Management Systems**
- Hire HR at 30 employees, formal performance management at 40-50 employees
- Do monthly 1-on-1s with direct reports - non-negotiable
- Set quarterly goals for everyone (main cause of underperformance is lack of direction)
- Interview target: 15 interviews/week for first 2 years
- Require unanimous "Yes" votes for hires (single "No" = don't hire)

**Time & Meeting Management**
- Email management: Use multiple inbox system (HubSpot method)
- 30-minute Sunday calendar review weekly
- Two meeting types only: decision-making or information-gathering
- 1-hour meeting = 30 minutes prep minimum
- Ask for agenda + your expected role before accepting any meeting

**Culture & Leadership**
- Culture requires constant repetition - "speak, shout, repeat, chant, recite and roar"
- Lead by example always - people emulate what you do, not what you say
- Create circle of unshakably loyal people for crisis situations
- Monthly "All Hands" meetings (80%+ attendance for 3 years)

## Bottom Line
CEO success depends on systematic processes for cash tracking, people management, and decision-making speed rather than perfection, while constantly fundraising and protecting company downside.

# What’s the Second Job of a Startup CEO?

**Source:** https://blog.ycombinator.com/the-second-job-of-a-startup-ceo/
**Section:** Startups

---

## Key Insights

**Phase 2 CEO Transition (20-500 employees):**
- Must shift from "Doer-in-Chief" to "Company-Builder-in-Chief" 
- Delegate ALL Phase 1 activities (even product development) to focus on 3 CEO-only tasks
- Expect 25% of leadership hires to fail; fire underperforming executives quickly
- Success metric: 50% of time becomes unscheduled "think time"

**3 Non-Delegable CEO Tasks:**

1. **Leadership Team Building**
- Spend 50% of time hiring/managing senior executives
- Stage hires rather than hiring all at once
- Use executive search firms for first searches
- Manage executives to quarterly/annual outputs, not weekly tasks
- Patrick Collison's approach: Meet "best-in-world" candidates to calibrate judgment

2. **Mission-Strategy-Metrics Framework**
- Mission: Ambitious and permanent
- Strategy: Revisit twice yearly, write in long form
- Metrics: Focus on drivers of top-line results, not top-line itself
- Facebook example: "10 friends within 14 days" drove retention, not just "increase user growth"
- Over-communicate framework constantly

3. **Culture Nurturing**
- Culture = how people treat each other
- Don't write values solo; collaborate with early employees
- Values must reflect past authentic behavior, not aspirations
- Pixar example: Scrapped Toy Story 2 with 7 months left, closed studio 2 months for recovery

**Key Benchmarks:**
- Phase 2 starts: ~20-25 employees
- Phase 2 ends: ~400-500 employees  
- Executive failure rate: ~25%

## Bottom Line
Phase 2 CEOs must completely delegate operational work to focus exclusively on hiring executives, creating company-wide alignment through mission/strategy/metrics, and nurturing authentic culture based on past behaviors.

# A Guide to Seed Fundraising

**Source:** https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**When to Raise:**
- Wait until you have product-market fit with 10% weekly growth for several weeks
- Only raise when you can tell a compelling story: great product, right team, large opportunity
- Rule: when you can raise money, you should raise money

**How Much to Raise:**
- Engineer costs ~$15k/month all-in (rule of thumb for budgeting)
- Target 12-18 months of runway to next fundable milestone
- Aim for 10% dilution (ideal), max 25% dilution
- Seed rounds typically $500k-$1.5M, clustering around $600k

**Financing Structure:**
- Most seed rounds now use SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or convertible notes
- Equity rounds are rare for seed due to complexity/cost
- Use standard documents (YC's SAFE) - well-understood by investors

**Valuation Benchmarks:**
- Seed valuations typically range $2M-$10M
- Don't over-optimize valuation - getting the deal matters more than maximizing price
- Let market set your price through investor competition

**Investor Strategy:**
- Angels: faster decisions, more emotional, invest own money
- VCs: longer process, multiple partners, see many deals
- Focus on investors most likely to close first - momentum builds after first money in
- Goal in first meeting: get next meeting, not close the deal

**Pitch Essentials:**
- Executive summary: 1-2 pages max covering vision, product, team, traction, market size
- Demo almost always required
- Get investor talking more than you = higher deal probability
- Always end with clear next steps or attempted close

**Process Rules:**
- First money is hardest - focus efforts there
- Once someone says yes, close immediately (handshake protocol)
- Don't negotiate in real-time - take requests away for consideration
- Standard closing should take minutes with proper documents

## Bottom Line
Raise money when you have 10% weekly growth and can tell a compelling story, target 12-18 months runway with standard SAFEs, and optimize for speed over valuation since first money creates momentum for subsequent closes.

# Equity 101 for Software Engineers at Big Tech and Startups

**Source:** https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/equity-for-software-engineers/
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**Equity Scale at Top Companies:**
- Staff+ engineers at Big Tech often receive more in stock annually than base salary
- Total comp packages >$250K US / €150K EU typically have significant equity components

**Successful Outcomes (Examples):**
- $12M gain: DoorDash SWE2 who joined 2018
- $10M gain: First 10 Amplitude engineers (4-year vest)
- $6M gain: Databricks engineer with 50K options (late 2018)
- €500K/year: Snap engineer in Europe due to 6x stock rise

**Critical Vesting Terms:**
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff (private cos), quarterly/monthly vesting
- Red flags: >4 year vesting, 90-day exercise windows, equity clawbacks
- Seek: 10-year post-termination exercise windows

**Options vs RSUs Trade-offs:**
- Options: Upside potential but require cash to exercise + taxes before liquidity
- RSUs (public cos): Immediate value, can sell after vesting
- Double-trigger RSUs (pre-IPO): No tax until liquidity event

**Tax Reality Check:**
- Secfi study: Taxes averaged 6x the exercise price at unicorns
- Early exercising can save 20%+ in taxes (Snowflake case study)
- Consider financing solutions (Secfi, EquityBee) for large option packages

**Dilution Impact:**
- 20x company growth ≠ 20x equity value due to dilution
- Typical outcome: 5-15x gains despite dilution from fundraising rounds

**Failure Modes:**
- WeWork: Employees lost hundreds of thousands in taxes on $50/share stock that became $4
- Good Technology: $1B→$425M fire sale left option holders with nothing
- FanDuel: $465M acquisition, employees got zero

## Bottom Line
Equity can generate life-changing wealth for engineers at top companies, but requires understanding vesting terms, tax implications, and substantial downside risk.

# Framework for balancing and budgeting engineering resourcing

**Source:** https://medium.com/engineering-operations/a-framework-for-balancing-and-budgeting-engineering-resourcing-d0cce0e6911c
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**Framework Structure:**
- 4 buckets: Keep the Lights On (KTLO) + 3 elective categories with 60/20/20% target split
- Build new stuff (customer acquisition/upsell): ~60%
- Improve existing stuff (customer satisfaction/retention): ~20% 
- Increase productivity (internal tooling/automation): ~20%
- KTLO defined as "minimum tasks to maintain current service level" - be rigorous to prevent gaming

**KTLO Categories:**
- Security audits, uptime maintenance, customer defect fixes
- Routine procedures, dependency updates (browsers, libraries, platforms)
- On-call duties, monitoring, troubleshooting

**Operational Process:**
- Annual strategic planning: Review previous year's allocation, adjust targets based on company goals
- Quarterly team reviews: Expected vs actual allocation reporting (lightweight, led by engineering directors)
- Initial rollout requires engineering/product leadership offsite for buy-in and clarity

**Key Success Factors:**
- Framework must be MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
- 60/20/20 applies to overall org, not individual teams
- Perfect accounting is non-goal - "good enough" works
- Communicate beyond engineering to all partner organizations
- KTLO% varies by company but should be consistent within organization

**Observed Benefits:**
- Forced clarity on project goals and KPI selection
- Reduced interdepartmental tension and politics
- Better director-level alignment on resource allocation
- Simple existence of framework drove 95% of desired behavior changes

## Bottom Line

# How To Invest In Startups

**Source:** https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**Access to deals:**
- Most investors don't work hard - exploit this by outworking them
- Instead of asking for deal flow, offer to work 1 day/week helping contacts' best companies
- Build brand through long-form content (few do well) vs tweeting (everyone does)
- Focus on helping other respected investors and good founders

**Decision-making framework:**
- Ask: "Would I work for this person?" and "Can I imagine them taking over their industry?"
- Rate of improvement matters more than current ability - meet founders 3x in 3 months, look for detectable progress each time
- Fast email response correlation: "Almost never made money investing in founders who don't respond quickly to important emails"
- Only invest in potential $10B+ companies due to power law dynamics
- Focus on market growth rate and eventual size, not current market size

**Key founder traits:**
- Scrappy + formidable (rare combination)
- Fast movers (hard to change personality trait)
- Mission-oriented, relentless, high-conviction
- Believe they are "eventually certain to be successful"

**Best company characteristics checklist:**
- Compelling founders
- Mission that attracts talent
- Product people spontaneously tell friends about
- Rapidly growing market
- Network effects + low marginal costs
- 10x better than existing options or fundamentally new

**Closing tactics:**
- Decide quickly before other investors
- Treat founders as peers, not subordinates
- Build reputation for being "above-and-beyond helpful"

**Helping portfolio companies:**
- Primary goal: make founders more ambitious with bigger self-belief
- Give specific tactical advice, not general strategy
- Most "vague help" requests are really asking for emotional support

## Bottom Line
Startup investing success requires outworking competitors for deal access, betting only on potential $10B+ companies with fast-improving founders, and treating those founders as peers while providing tactical support.

# IPOs and Beyond: A Guide to Exit Options for Companies

**Source:** https://future.a16z.com/ipos-and-beyond-a-guide-to-exit-options-for-companies/
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**Exit Option Economics:**
- IPOs see average 18% price increase from initial range to final pricing since 2019; 33% first-day pop for enterprise tech since 2020
- SPACs cost 15-20% in sponsor fees + warrants + higher transaction costs; PIPE discount now 25-30% (up from 15-20%)
- Direct Listings eliminate IPO discount but only 10 deals completed (1% of market)
- M&A generally produces lower valuations than IPOs in hot markets due to buyer expertise and forecast haircuts

**Market Dynamics:**
- 700+ unicorns worth ~$2.2T globally creating massive IPO backlog
- Only ~20% of IPO allocation goes to "flippers," creating supply scarcity driving pops
- Global M&A at $4T through Aug 2021 (record high); tech sector $1.1T (up 182%)
- Secondary market growing: Carta facilitated $4.7B across 77 programs in 9 months 2021 vs $2.2B in full year 2020

**Structural Changes:**
- SPAC approval timeline increased from 3.5 to 5.5 months due to SEC scrutiny
- NYSE/Nasdaq approved primary capital raising for Direct Listings
- Companies typically limit employee secondary sales to ~10% of vested shares
- Secondary trading prices now influence Direct Listing reference prices

**Decision Framework:**
- IPOs/DLs best for strong companies in hot markets seeking highest valuations
- SPACs for companies with less-proven models needing earlier public access
- M&A for guaranteed full exit but likely lower valuations
- Secondary sales for employee retention without company exit

## Bottom Line
Exit choice depends on company maturity and market conditions, with IPOs offering highest valuations in hot markets but SPACs providing earlier access for less-proven companies at significantly higher cost.

# Negotiate the right deal with suppliers

**Source:** https://www.infoentrepreneurs.org/en/guides/negotiate-the-right-deal-with-suppliers/
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

- Define negotiation priorities beyond price: delivery times, payment terms, quality, lifetime costs, after-sales service, and business criticality
- Research supplier's market position: monopolies have upper hand, new entrants/competitors give you leverage
- Assess your value to supplier: if you're their main customer, you have considerable leverage but risk damaging service quality if you push too hard
- Time negotiations strategically: target salespeople near monthly quota deadlines
- Match negotiating team seniority to supplier's representatives
- Never accept first offer - make low counter-offer and ask what else they can include at given price
- For artificially high "permanently discounted" prices, negotiate beyond standard discount levels
- Expose ongoing costs (repairs, consumables) to make asking price appear high
- Credit check suppliers before long-term contracts, especially single-source providers
- Get references from other customers, but remember suppliers won't provide dissatisfied clients
- Include specific contract clauses: ownership retention until full payment, liability limitations, delivery penalties, dispute resolution procedures
- Build in after-sales service requirements and failure remedies (individual vs. batch replacement, timeframes)

## Bottom Line

Successful supplier negotiations require balancing short-term gains with long-term relationship value while leveraging your market research and bargaining power strategically.

# Option grants at seed

**Source:** https://www.indexventures.com/rewardingtalent/option-grants-at-seed
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**ESOP Size & Benchmarks:**
- US late-stage startups: employees own ~20% vs 10% in Europe
- European ownership ranges 4-20% (inconsistent), US more standardized at market-driven levels
- Recommended ESOP sizes: 10-20% at seed, 12% Series A, 14% Series B, 16% Series C
- European startups "flat line" ESOPs at 10% while US grows to 20-25% by Series D

**Grant Allocation Framework:**
- Seed stage: Senior engineers 1.0%, mid-level 0.45%, junior 0.15% of FDE
- Series A executives: C-suite 0.8-1.5%, VPs 0.3-0.8% of FDE  
- Staff grants: Calculate as % of base salary (Engineering directors 75%, seniors 50%, individuals 33%)
- Use 9-box performance matrix: Rate performance + potential on 3-point scale to determine multipliers

**Vesting & Retention:**
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff, monthly after cliff
- Consider back-loaded vesting (10%-20%-30%-40%) vs linear (25% yearly) for better retention
- Only 4-5 of first 20 employees typically stay through IPO
- Extended exercise periods (90 days standard, consider 1 year per year of tenure)

**Critical Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Full acceleration vesting for all employees (kills acquisitions)
- European-style bad leaver provisions (too punitive)
- High strike prices when low FMV available
- Vague equity promises without formal documentation

**Specific Numbers:**
- At $1B exit: 1% equity = $10M gross (before dilution/tax)
- Typical Series A team: 50 new hires below executive level
- All-employee schemes: 75% adoption in Bay Area vs 32% continental Europe

## Bottom Line
European startups systematically under-allocate equity compared to US counterparts, losing talent competition and limiting scale potential—aim for 12-16% ESOPs with performance-driven grants using salary-based calculations rather than ad-hoc percentage allocations.

# Options vs Cash

**Source:** https://danluu.com/startup-options/
**Section:** Money / Finance

---

## Key Insights

**Tax Structure**
- ISOs have preferential tax treatment but most nonstatutory options create taxable income at exercise (fair market value minus strike price)
- Strike price must equal fair market value for ISOs; private companies get infrequent third-party valuations creating potential discounts

**Financial Reality Check**
- Working at big tech + investing $25k/year in startups beats joining startups financially
- At $10M seed valuations: $100k investment = 1% equity vs. 4-year vesting + worse equity class as employee
- Median employee at 99%-ile exits ($1B+) underperforms standard Facebook/Google/Amazon career trajectory
- Netflix's all-cash model shows better retention than equity-heavy startups

**Options as Control Mechanism**
- Lock-in effect keeps employees through illiquid vesting schedules
- Companies retain more control giving options to employees vs. equity to VCs (employee equity spread across many people)
- Poor retention mechanism in practice - cash-paying companies have lower attrition

**Performance Misalignment**
- Options decouple job performance from compensation
- Company picking matters infinitely more than individual performance
- Microsoft created ~10,000 millionaires; most had no instrumental role in success
- Post-IPO joiners at major tech companies often outperform pre-IPO startup employees

**Valuation Arbitrage**
- Third-party valuations updated infrequently and incentivized to stay low (paid by startups)
- Creates gaps between "real" and legal valuations, but offers adjust accordingly

## Bottom Line

Startup options primarily benefit founders and investors through employee lock-in and control retention, while employees would generally earn more working at big tech companies and investing surplus cash directly in startups.

- Two toolchain approaches: all-in-one (complete but inflexible) vs open toolchain (customizable with integrations)
- Core practices stack: Continuous Integration → Continuous Delivery → Infrastructure as Code → Microservices → Monitoring
- DevSecOps integrates security into CI/CD pipeline rather than treating it as separate phase
- Culture change requires breaking silos, shared accountability across entire product lifecycle
- Over-reliance on tools fails without proper team structure and processes foundation
- Feature flags enable gradual rollouts instead of all-at-once deployments
- Microservices architecture enables independent deployment and operation of services
- "Shift left" monitoring catches issues earlier in development vs production
- Infrastructure as Code treats infrastructure definitions like actual code with version control and reviews

## Bottom Line

DevOps success requires cultural transformation and process changes first, with elite teams achieving 200x deployment frequency through automation, monitoring, and breaking down organizational silos.

# Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names

**Source:** https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

- Names are far more complex than any system accounts for - there is no such thing as a "canonical" name format
- People can have multiple valid full names they go by simultaneously (author acknowledges 6 different versions)
- Names change unpredictably - not just at marriage/divorce but at any time for any reason
- Character encoding assumptions fail globally - names use ASCII, Unicode, mixed character sets, numbers, all caps, all lowercase
- First/last name separation is culturally biased - many cultures don't follow this pattern
- Name uniqueness is myth - millions can share identical names, especially in China/Asia
- Database schemas with `first_name`/`last_name` columns are fundamentally broken
- Systems that validate names against "acceptable characters" are discriminatory by design
- Two operators entering the same person's name will produce different strings due to spelling variations
- Some people have no names at all in traditional Western sense
- Dictionary-based profanity filters will inevitably block legitimate names
- Name assignment timing varies - not always at birth, sometimes years later
- Global systems must handle naming conventions from every culture simultaneously
- Any transformation algorithm for names will cause data loss

## Bottom Line

Every assumption developers make about names is wrong, and robust systems must accept any string a person claims as their name without validation or transformation.

# HackerNews discussion

**Source:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12197795
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiation effectiveness changes with experience level**:
  - Junior devs: Difference between $70k and $90k candidate is simply declaring yourself as $90k candidate
  - Senior devs ($120k+): Harder to jump from $140k to $180k; often pushed toward management roles
  - $255k appears to be a ceiling outside Big Tech (tied to average CEO salary caps)

- **Information asymmetry is critical**:
  - Companies know their budget ranges; candidates don't
  - Stop disclosing previous salary to recruiters/employers
  - Research compensation via Glassdoor, network contacts before interviewing
  - Script: "My employer asked me to keep compensation confidential"

- **High earners ($750k+) use different channels**:
  - Don't go through standard recruiters or job boards
  - Work with specialized headhunters for niche roles
  - Possess domain expertise beyond just programming skills
  - Can translate technical skills into direct business value

- **Negotiation power comes from alternatives**:
  - Having multiple offers is the strongest negotiation position
  - Without alternatives, you have limited leverage
  - Geographic markets vary significantly in opportunity density

- **Timing and process matter**:
  - Establish salary ranges upfront to avoid wasted time
  - Beware "exploding offers" (especially targeting junior developers)
  - Take time to consider offers; don't decide on the spot

- **Company perspective shifts outcome**:
  - Treat as ongoing relationship, not one-time transaction
  - Managers often care little about your exact salary once hired
  - Higher negotiated salary can improve performance (better commute, less financial stress)

## Bottom Line

Salary negotiation becomes fundamentally different at higher experience levels, requiring market research, multiple offers, and specialized channels rather than just declaring higher numbers.

# How to Prepare a Talk

**Source:** https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

**Preparation Framework:**
- Talk prep is primarily about talking out loud, not writing slides - practice speaking while standing/pacing in private space
- Do exactly one run-through per day to allow partial forgetting between sessions, preventing robotic delivery
- Start with zero plan - improvise on topic for 15 minutes to 2 hours, capturing interesting moments as simple note slides
- Repeat 3+ times, rearranging/adding/deleting slides based on what feels natural when spoken

**ROI Math:**
- 500-person audience × 30-minute talk = 250 person-hours consumed
- Popular talk videos get 50,000+ views = 25,000 person-hours optimized
- 20 hours prep time = 1,250:1 ratio of viewer time to preparation time

**Structure Development:**
- After ~4 practice runs, group slides into 4-8 sections with short names
- Use stark visual contrast (white-on-black section slides, black-on-white content slides)
- Build complex slides (code, tables) piece-by-piece to control audience attention
- Cut sections when practice runs become annoying - this indicates talk is ready for reduction

**Technical Specs:**
- Font size: Capital X height should be ≥0.03× slide height for back-row visibility
- Safety margins: 0.05× screen width/height on all sides to avoid projection issues
- Target length: 25 minutes is sweet spot; most 50-minute talks are bloated 25-minute talks

**Final Optimization:**
- When talk feels too long, hide least-interesting sections and test flow
- Practice section transitions 10× when cutting content
- Stop major changes when you no longer feel compelled to edit
- Never practice more than once on talk day to avoid voice fatigue

## Bottom Line
Build talks through daily improvisation sessions rather than slide writing, using spoken repetition and strategic forgetting to develop authentic, well-structured presentations that optimize thousands of person-hours of audience time.

# How to Use OpenAPI and Swagger for Documentation

**Source:** https://blog.readme.com/how-to-use-openapi-and-swagger-spec-for-documentation/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

**Core Problem & Solution:**
- Manual API documentation is the biggest developer headache (2019 Postman survey) - becomes outdated, inaccurate, and neglected
- OpenAPI/Swagger solves this by providing machine-readable API descriptions that auto-generate always-current documentation

**Key Technical Differences:**
- Swagger 2.0 (2014) became OpenAPI 2.0 (identical format, starts with `swagger: "2.0"`)
- OpenAPI 3.0+ (2017) is current standard (starts with `openapi: "3.0.0"`)
- OpenAPI 3.0 added "components" section for flexibility and webhook support via "callbacks"

**Automation Opportunities:**
- Generate documentation that deploys with API changes
- Contract testing: validate API responses match specifications automatically
- Auto-generate server stubs, SDKs, mock servers, and code samples in multiple languages
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation

**Implementation Best Practices:**
- Choose YAML (more human-readable) or JSON (familiar to web devs) - both convertible
- Use REST patterns: organize around resources, use HTTP methods for actions, standard status codes
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (singular vs plural, capitalization)
- Write meaningful descriptions and summaries for human readers
- Start with templates, use editor plugins with linters for syntax checking

**Generation from Existing APIs:**
- Framework-specific tools: `zero-rails_openapi` (Rails), `falcon-apispec` (Python)
- Traffic analysis tools like Optic can generate specs from live API calls

## Bottom Line

OpenAPI specifications solve API documentation hell by creating machine-readable contracts that automatically generate always-current docs while enabling extensive automation for testing, code generation, and CI/CD integration.

# Knowledge-Sharing Architects As An Alternative to Coding Architects

**Source:** http://ithare.com/knowledge-sharing-architects-as-an-alternative-to-coding-architects/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights
- Knowledge-sharing architects focus on disseminating technical knowledge rather than direct coding, addressing the bottleneck of architectural expertise concentration
- Two main approaches: "Broadcasting" (one-to-many presentations, documentation) and "Mentoring" (one-on-one guidance with individual developers)
- Broadcasting scales better but lacks personalization; mentoring provides deeper impact but doesn't scale
- Hybrid model recommended: Use broadcasting for foundational concepts, mentoring for complex problem-solving
- Metrics to track: number of developers trained, architectural decision quality improvements, reduced escalation to senior architects
- Common failure modes: architects who can't communicate effectively, over-reliance on documentation without interactive elements
- Implementation pattern: Start with 20% time allocation to knowledge sharing, measure impact, then adjust
- Knowledge-sharing architects should rotate between teams to prevent knowledge silos
- Documentation should be living/interactive rather than static - wikis, decision trees, and recorded decision rationales work better than lengthy documents

## Bottom Line
Replace coding architects with knowledge-sharing architects who multiply impact through teaching and mentoring, using a hybrid broadcast/mentoring model to scale architectural expertise across teams.

# Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued

**Source:** https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiations have massive lifetime impact**: A $5K increase compounds to ~$100K over 10 years through annual raises, 401k matching, and higher baseline for future roles

- **Companies view salaries differently than you**: Your $5K request is 3% of fully-loaded cost (~$20K/month for CA/NY engineers). HR sees "mouse droppings," you see life-changing money

- **Your hiring manager Bob isn't spending his own money**: He gets no meaningful reward for saving $5K but benefits from higher budgets and managing expensive talent

- **Never give a number first**: This is so critical that volunteering salary info signals "catastrophic incompetence" to hiring managers, like flunking FizzBuzz signals to engineers

- **Only negotiate after "Yes-If"**: Must have agreement-in-principle from hiring authority before discussing compensation. Never negotiate from "No-But"

- **Standard objections to dodge**: 
  - "Need a number to move forward" → "Let's focus on mutual fit first"
  - "Form requires number" → "Put $1, we'll circle back"
  - "Need to check if you're appropriate" → Redirect to your qualifications

- **Use their language back**: Mirror key phrases from job descriptions ("scaling traffic," "fast-moving environment"). Take notes during interviews to capture their specific concerns and words

- **Research compensation levers**: Some companies push back on salary but give stock options easily. Learn what's negotiable before you negotiate

- **Multi-dimensional trading**: Don't fixate on salary alone. Trade vacation days, professional development, work arrangements for salary concessions. Say offers are "interesting" (positive but non-committal)

- **Have an external authority**: "I'll need to discuss with family" creates legitimate delay and negotiating room

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation is a 5-minute conversation that determines 10+ years of lifetime earnings, yet engineers systematically under-negotiate due to viewing it as morally questionable rather than standard business practice.

# Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer

**Source:** https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

**Fundamental Mindset Shifts:**
- Employment is selling your labor, not "getting a job" - approach as a market transaction
- Always negotiate - offers are rescinded <1% of time, usually for egregious behavior
- Information asymmetry is your only power - never reveal salary expectations, current comp, or decision timeline

**The 10 Rules (6 covered):**
1. **Get everything in writing** - Document all verbal details immediately
2. **Always keep the door open** - Avoid premature commitments at decision points
3. **Information is power** - Protect what you're thinking/wanting; force them to guess
4. **Always be positive** - Excitement is your most valuable negotiating asset
5. **Don't be the decision-maker** - Reference family/friends to deflect pressure tactics
6. **Have alternatives** - Use any offer to create urgency at other companies

**Tactical Execution:**
- First response to offers: "Sounds great! Talking to other companies, will get back to you"
- Immediately notify all other companies about your offer to accelerate their timelines
- Fight exploding offers (<72hr expiration) by explicitly calling them unreasonable - companies will extend
- Target larger companies early (slower processes), startups later (faster cycles)
- Maximize overlapping offer windows for negotiation leverage

**Company Psychology:**
- Multiple offers create stronger signal than single interviews (weak/noisy data)
- Companies rationally value candidates with other offers as validation
- Different companies value different skill sets - find where you're most valuable

## Bottom Line
Negotiation is information warfare where your only advantage is keeping employers uncertain about what it takes to close you.

# The Pyramid Principle

**Source:** https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

**Core Framework:**
- Start with the answer first - lead with "You should do X" immediately
- Group supporting arguments into 3 buckets maximum (Rule of 3)
- Order ideas logically: time order (cause-effect), structural order (comprehensive parts), or degree order (most to least important)

**Why Answer-First Works:**
- Maximizes time with busy executives who may already agree and move on
- Matches executive thinking patterns (top-down, big picture focus)
- Creates assertiveness and confidence perception vs. searching for words

**Pyramid Structure Rules:**
- Single thought at top = answer to executive's question
- Each level must summarize the ideas grouped below it
- Ideas in same group must be same importance level and logically connected
- Break down until you form complete pyramid of supporting evidence

**Tactical Applications:**
- Use for investor pitches, board presentations, stakeholder proposals
- Counter-intuitive for technical backgrounds used to building up to conclusions
- Audiences naturally group/summarize anyway - help them do it effectively

## Bottom Line

Lead with your recommendation immediately, then support it with 3 logical argument groups to maximize executive attention and persuasion effectiveness.

# Undervalued Software Engineering Skills: Writing Well

**Source:** https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/
**Section:** Related stuff

---

## Key Insights

- Writing becomes critical when engineering teams exceed "a few dozen people" - face-to-face communication breaks down at scale
- Writing enables engineers to influence beyond immediate peers, essential for progression from senior to staff/principal/distinguished levels
- Key documents to make durable: proposals, decisions, coding guidelines, best practices, runbooks, debugging guides, postmortems, code reviews
- Well-written content scales communication efficiency across multiple teams and organizations
- Fundamental improvement tactics: ruthlessly re-edit your own writing, put yourself in reader's shoes, challenge yourself to deliver same message in shorter form
- Recommended tools: Grammarly and Hemingway App for immediate feedback
- Recommended books: "On Writing Well" and "The Sense of Style"
- Get feedback from colleagues who write well
- Google SVP Urs Hölzle (employee #8) confirms writing as "important superpower for engineers"

## Bottom Line

Writing well is an undervalued but essential skill that enables senior engineers to scale their influence beyond immediate teams as organizations grow beyond face-to-face communication limits.

# 8 Product Hurdles Every Founder Must Clear

**Source:** https://review.firstround.com/8-product-hurdles-every-founder-must-clear-this-pm-turned-founder-shares-his-playbooks
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Customer Discovery & Market Validation:**
- Use cold outreach, never friends/network for validation - if strangers won't spend time, your idea isn't worth pursuing
- Apply outcome-driven innovation: collect 20-40 customer outcomes, measure importance vs satisfaction - unsatisfied+important = opportunity
- Focus on underserved segments within crowded markets, not new categories
- Validate customer/problem fit before product/market fit - measure problem severity and interest in solving it

**MVP & Early Product:**
- Build only what you can't do manually - everything else should be high-touch service initially
- Sprig's first version was just an SDK; founder personally built analysis decks and managed all configurations
- Manual approach validates core value before expensive automation

**Customer Conversations:**
- Treat feedback calls like awkward 1:1s with direct reports
- Key questions: "0-10 satisfaction with our company, what gets you to 10?" and "What feature wouldn't you miss if removed?"
- Invalidate ideas quickly - better to kill after weeks than 18 months of development

**Founder-Led Sales:**
- Submarine technique: start each meeting by stating the small decision needed at the end (not a big purchase decision)
- Document your evolving playbook in Google Docs after every call
- Let product do the selling - offer trials before discussing pricing
- Need repeatable ICP + repeatable process before hiring sales team

**Product Expansion:**
- Stay within your category (per G2 definitions) - spanning categories dilutes offering
- Look at other tools customers use alongside yours for adjacent opportunities
- Follow 8-step customer job flow to find gaps you don't solve yet

## Bottom Line
Focus on underserved segments within existing categories, validate through cold outreach, build manually first, ask brutally honest questions, and expand within your category rather than across categories.

# Execution at Facebook

**Source:** https://productlife.to/p/-execution-at-facebook
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**PM Role Definition:**
- PMs responsible for 2 outcomes: strategy ("what game we're playing") and execution ("how we play it")
- Strategy = finding investment areas + creating compelling vision aligned with users/business
- Execution = prioritization/roadmapping + process management (brief → launch)
- PMs 100% accountable for team results regardless of who does the work

**Meta-Execution Framework:**
- Meta-execution = executing through others to scale impact
- Stack rank execution tasks by PM uniqueness: strategy/vision (always PM) → communication/project mgmt (can delegate)
- Senior PMs focus on problems only they can solve, delegate execution to capable team leaders
- Enables PM capacity for long-term strategy while maintaining accountability

**Empowered vs Non-Empowered Teams:**
- Non-empowered: exist "to serve the business" (assigned projects)
- Empowered: exist "to serve customers in ways that meet business needs" (choose what to build)
- Empowered teams evaluated on outcomes, not inputs
- Engineers want PMs finding high-impact projects rather than managing task execution

**Engineer-PM Collaboration Patterns:**
- Engineers drive: solution ownership, progress tracking, feature-level meetings/docs, project management execution
- PMs drive: roadmap process, team-level structure/communication, milestone frameworks
- Engineers gain product decision involvement through execution ownership
- Team adjusts roles dynamically based on highest impact allocation

**Success Metrics:**
- Nobody cares about Gantt charts, only on-time delivery
- Nobody cares about meeting agendas, only project impact
- Focus on outputs (results) not inputs (tasks)

## Bottom Line
Facebook PMs succeed by owning outcomes while delegating execution to engineers who want product ownership, creating empowered teams that optimize for impact over role boundaries.

# How to Hire a Product Manager

**Source:** https://www.kennorton.com/essays/productmanager.html
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Prioritize raw intelligence over experience**
- Smart, inexperienced PM beats average intellect with years of experience
- Test reaction to analytical challenges - best candidates get excited, counter with own questions
- Ask questions until you're sure candidate is smarter than you

**Technical background critical but with caveats**
- Technical PMs can relate to engineers and grasp product complexities
- Major pitfall: Former engineers who still try to control technical decisions crash spectacularly
- Prefer technical people who've already transitioned to PM role at previous job

**Product instincts are innate, not learnable**
- Look for candidates who independently echo your product concerns
- They should teach you something new about your product during interview
- Should turn you on to something innovative you hadn't heard of
- Can be tuned but cannot be learned from scratch

**Leadership without authority**
- PMs lead by influence, not direct reports
- Most effective evaluation: reference checks with peers and individual contributors
- Must wear multiple hats - advocate for whoever isn't in the room (customer, engineering, sales, executives)

**Interview process structure**
- Include representatives from engineering, design, marketing minimum
- Get specific functional feedback: "see how well they'd understand channel development issues"
- Don't require everyone's thumbs-up, but get diverse perspectives

**Shipping experience trumps theory**
- Unless very junior role, hire PMs who've shipped start-to-finish
- Past performance indicates future success
- Check references with manager, engineering counterparts, sales/marketing partners

## Bottom Line
Hire the smartest person with technical background, innate product instincts, and proven shipping experience - everything else can be developed.

# How to Write Your First Strategic Roadmap

**Source:** https://ganotnoa.com/how-to-write-your-first-strategic-roadmap-part-1/
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Roadmap Definition:**
- Roadmap = strategic document, NOT a work plan or feature list
- Functions as navigation guide, communication tool, and alignment mechanism
- For startups: limit to one goal maximum to maintain focus

**6 Essential Components:**

1. **Goal** - Business outcome you're trying to achieve
   - Examples: increase POC→contract conversion, get 5 enterprise logos, reduce churn
   - Must answer: What business results enable next funding round? What prevents achieving this today?

2. **Reasoning** - Detailed explanation of why these goals are correct
   - Use full explanations, not bullet points
   - Creates opportunity for strategic alignment discussion before implementation

3. **Route** - Large milestones with clear logical progression
   - Example sequence: Support ideal customer → Scale identical use cases → Expand to adjacent use cases → Target new segments
   - Each milestone must connect logically to the next

4. **ETA** - Quarterly-level time estimates, not day-accurate timelines
   - Purpose: assess if route is feasible before "trains leave station" (funding runs out, competitors win, market shifts)

5. **Risks & Mitigation** - Worst-case scenarios with prepared responses
   - Add measurements and checkpoints to monitor risk levels

6. **What You Won't Do** - Explicit exclusions to maintain focus
   - Evaluate all product requests against chosen route
   - Requires courage to say no to customer/executive requests

**Process Rules:**
- Don't mix multiple goal routes until each is individually validated and logical
- Route must be "plausible on paper" before real-world validation

## Bottom Line
A strategic roadmap is a business navigation tool with clear goals, reasoning, and deliberate exclusions - not a feature wish list with dates.

# If You Don’t Think You Need a VP of Product...

**Source:** https://www.saastr.com/if-you-dont-think-you-need-a-vp-of-product-marketing-etc-then-you-havent-worked-with-a-great-one/
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

- At $1.5M ARR (Initial Traction), you're ready for VPs across all functions, not just sales
- VP of Product becomes critical when scaling from 100 to 1,000+ customers and simple to complex feature sets - handles enterprise customer synthesis that founders can't manage at scale
- VP of Marketing must own lead/opportunity commits and revenue numbers - junior roles only provide "help," VPs drive $1.5M to $10M growth acceleration
- VP of Customer Success should carry expansion revenue targets (10-20% YoY growth from installed base) and aggressively attack churn/almost-churn with systematic processes
- VP of Engineering frees CTO from "been done before" work (scaling, security, devops, hiring) to focus on novel innovation only they can do
- Common founder mistake: hiring directors instead of VPs to save money - 95% of the time only VPs can truly own outcomes and numbers
- VP of Business Development needed because CEOs lack 40+ hours/week for partner relationship management across multiple stakeholders
- Cash constraints are valid but separate from readiness - most founders think they're "not ready" when they actually just haven't worked with great VPs
- Great VPs are accretive and self-funding through productivity gains and faster growth
- Key milestone: transition from "Repeatable" to "Repeating" revenue signals VP readiness across all functions

## Bottom Line
Once you hit $1.5M ARR, you need great VPs in every function because they own outcomes and accelerate growth in ways junior hires cannot, and resistance usually means you've never worked with a truly great VP before.

# Most Startups Should Be Deer Hunters

**Source:** https://bothsidesofthetable.com/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters-7fdecf58f4f6
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Animal Customer Segmentation Framework:**
- **Elephants (Enterprise)**: High-value deals ($500k-$1M+) but consume all development resources through custom features, steep SLAs, and service demands. Can make startups lose strategic focus
- **Rabbits (SMB/Freemium)**: $5-40/month customers. High volume needed but hard to catch, low revenue per customer makes economics difficult unless building massive scale (Twitter/Facebook model)  
- **Deer (Mid-market)**: Right-sized customers who pay fair prices, make reasonable demands, don't control your roadmap, and allow strategic focus

**Specific Problems with Elephants:**
- Force you to build "missing" features that steer you off MVP
- Require custom development that other customers won't use
- Demand high service levels that consume entire teams
- Create single points of failure - losing one customer can devastate the business
- Make simultaneous SMB serving nearly impossible due to different needs/channels

**Rabbit Economics Don't Work Unless:**
- Building massive transaction volume business (social networks, gaming)
- Have proven partner distribution channels
- Can achieve true self-service with minimal support costs

**Deer Hunting Benefits:**
- Customers can't make huge demands on development resources
- Won't negotiate standard terms extensively  
- Losing one customer isn't devastating
- Allows maintaining strategic focus without compromise
- Easier to serve and scale

**Real Example:** Author's first company landed $500k-$1M European enterprise deals but spent all resources on custom features and high-touch service instead of core product development.

## Bottom Line
Most startups should target mid-market "deer" customers who pay fair prices but can't force you to abandon your product strategy through excessive customization demands.

# Product North Star Metric

**Source:** https://amplitude.com/blog/product-north-star-metric
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**North Star Metric Structure:**
- Must combine: product vision statement + measurable metric
- Should capture customer "aha moment" - early actions that lead to retention
- Must be leading indicator, not lagging (avoid monthly revenue, ARPU)
- Gets you closest to actual customer value impact

**Three Business Game Types:**
1. Attention Game: Time spent in product (Facebook, Netflix)
2. Transaction Game: Number of transactions (Amazon, Walmart) 
3. Productivity Game: Work efficiency (Salesforce, Adobe)

**Proven Examples:**
- Facebook: "# users adding 7 friends in first 10 days"
- Fortune 100 retailer: "mobile orders delivered" 
- SaaS trial: "trial accounts with >3 users active in week 1"

**Input Framework Pattern:**
- Use 3-5 inputs following breadth, depth, frequency, efficiency dimensions
- Each team maps their work to specific inputs affecting the North Star

**One Metric Rule:**
- Single P&L/product team = one North Star maximum
- Prevents diluted focus and conflicting priorities
- Enables clear trade-off decisions across organization

**Selection Process:**
- First identify which of the 3 games your business plays
- Find metric closest to customer value realization
- Ensure it's predictive of future revenue, not historical

## Bottom Line

A North Star Metric must capture customer value through leading indicators tied to one of three business games (attention, transaction, productivity), with 3-5 measurable inputs that teams can directly influence through product decisions.

# Product vs. Feature Teams

**Source:** https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Three Types of Teams:**
- Delivery teams: "Backlog administrators" running SAFe/Scrum with product owners doing administrative work (repackaged waterfall)
- Feature teams: Cross-functional but serve predefined roadmaps, focused on output delivery
- Product teams: Empowered, outcome-focused, solve problems vs deliver features

**Four Core Product Risks:**
- Value risk (will people buy/use it?)
- Usability risk (can users figure it out?)
- Feasibility risk (can we build it?)
- Business viability risk (works for our business?)

**Role Responsibility Split:**
- Product teams: PM owns value + viability, designer owns usability, tech lead owns feasibility
- Feature teams: Stakeholders own value + viability decisions, team just executes

**Feature Team Problems:**
- Can't attract/retain true product designers (end up with graphic designers)
- PM becomes project manager + unskilled designer hybrid
- Engineers relegated to delivery (losing half their value)
- Role confusion between PM and designer common
- Good talent leaves for empowered teams

**Feature Team Diagnostic Tests:**
- Given roadmaps with features/dates vs problems to solve?
- Role confusion with designer/delivery manager?
- Spend most time on project management?
- OKRs implementation was messy?
- Team acts like mercenaries vs missionaries?

**Critical Distinction:**
- Feature team PMs facilitate delivery; product team PMs need deep customer/business knowledge and ensure value/viability
- Same title, completely different skillsets required

## Bottom Line
Most "product teams" are actually feature teams executing predefined roadmaps, which wastes talent and delivers poor results compared to truly empowered product teams that own outcomes and solve problems.

# Red Oceans: How to Find Profitable Startup Ideas

**Source:** https://capitalandgrowth.org/answers/Article/3143488/How-to-Find-Profitable-Business-Ideas
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Internal Approach (Skills-Based):**
- 43% of entrepreneurs get ideas from same-industry experience - highest single source
- "Entrepreneurship by braille" - only pursuing what you know/like - limits opportunity scope
- Best ideas grow "organically" from founder expertise hitting external market stimulus

**External Approach (Market-First) Methods:**

**Market-Area Saturation Analysis:**
- Formula: (State establishments of type X ÷ state population) × target area population = expected number needed
- Example: 100K people should support 11.3 pizza places, 4.0 gyms, 1.0 bowling alley based on state averages
- Use Google Maps + census data to identify geographic gaps

**Competitive Matrix Framework:**
- Rate competitor performance vs. customer importance (1-5 scale) for each factor
- Gap of 1 point = small opportunity (competitors can adapt)
- Gap of 2+ points = significant exploitable opportunity
- Survey target segment for importance ratings, evaluate current providers

**Industry Growth Targeting:**
- Use IBIS Industry Reports, SageWorks for growth rates
- 2018 fastest growing: Marijuana retail (40.2%), Wind turbines (48.8%)
- Target industries growing 10-20x faster than overall economy

**Matrix Charting Systematic Search:**
- Grid: Product elements (vertical) × questions (horizontal): What/Where/Who/When/How can it be used?
- Fill boxes methodically to uncover gaps

**Slice of Life Decision Tree:**
- Divide life experiences in half repeatedly until reaching discrete problem areas
- Analyze each slice for specific pain points during that timeframe/activity

## Bottom Line
Red Ocean opportunities in established markets offer more reliable paths to profitable businesses than Blue Ocean innovation, using systematic gap analysis methods to find underserved demand.

# Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters

**Source:** https://basecamp.com/shapeup
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**6-Week Cycle Structure:**
- Work in 6-week cycles with 2-week cooldowns
- No extensions - ship or kill at cycle end
- Cooldown for bug fixes, exploration, small improvements

**Shaping (Pre-Work):**
- Define problem boundaries before development starts
- Set "appetite" (time budget) before solution design
- Create rough wireframes/breadboards, not detailed specs
- Identify specific risks and rabbit holes upfront
- Write formal pitches with problem, appetite, solution, risks

**Betting Process:**
- Senior stakeholders meet every 6 weeks to choose what to build
- No backlog grooming - bets expire if not chosen
- Circuit breaker: kill projects that don't ship in one cycle
- Small teams (1 designer + 1-2 developers) own entire features

**Building Phase:**
- Teams have full autonomy within shaped boundaries  
- Work on one meaningful piece end-to-end first
- Map work into "scopes" (integrated slices of the system)
- Show progress through completed scopes, not tasks/points
- Default to cutting scope when timeline pressure hits

**Key Frameworks:**
- Fat Marker Sketches: Rough concept drawings that prevent over-specification
- Breadboarding: Three elements only - places, affordances, connection lines
- Circuit Breakers: Automatic project termination prevents runaway work

## Bottom Line
Replace continuous backlogs and sprints with deliberate 6-week betting cycles where senior leaders shape work upfront and small teams ship complete features with full autonomy.

# The Secrets Of Creative Thinking

**Source:** https://www.lemonade.com/blog/creative-thinking-hacks/
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

- **Constrain yourself deliberately**: Unlimited freedom depletes creative energy. Pick one narrow slice of the problem (e.g., "hats for bearded guys") and focus all energy there
- **Generate 20+ ideas minimum**: Write your first idea, then consider it "not good enough" and force yourself to create 20 more before choosing
- **Apply the 3-filter test**: Does it move the needle? Will anyone care? Can it impact 1,000+ people?
- **Use the "boardroom test"**: If corporate executives wouldn't give you weird looks, you're not thinking creatively enough
- **Hold workshops outside the office**: Different environment breaks typical thought patterns; office settings kill creative flow
- **Feed your brain more inputs**: Creativity = recombining existing ideas, so consume more diverse sources (use Awwwards, CSS Design Awards for UX inspiration)
- **Write goals in big letters first**: Keeps you anchored to core framework while ideating
- **Choose your craziest viable idea**: Your most uncomfortable concepts are often your best; comfort zone = creative death zone
- **Get explicit permission to be crazy**: From stakeholders and yourself; fear of rejection kills big ideas
- **Set up your creative environment**: Most people need positive mood + personal optimal conditions (alone/with audience, music, etc.)

## Bottom Line
Creative thinking requires structured constraints, high-volume ideation (20+ ideas), and deliberately choosing the most uncomfortable viable option.

# The Top 10 Deliverables of Product Managers

**Source:** https://www.sachinrekhi.com/top-10-deliverables-of-product-managers
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Product Management Framework: 4 Core Dimensions**
- Vision, Strategy, Design, Execution - each requires specific deliverables vs just activities
- Vision narrative (1-2 pages prose) beats vision statements - provides context, storyline, and inspiration
- Strategy = 6 product/market fit hypotheses: Problem, Target audience, Value prop, Competitive advantage, Growth strategy, Business model

**Customer Discovery**
- Scott Cook rule: "When surprised, either upside or downside, the market is telling you something you don't know"
- Quality/quantity of surprise insights = what PMs optimize for in discovery
- PM owns insight synthesis and roadmap incorporation regardless of research resources

**Roadmap Prioritization: 4 Lenses Framework**
- Vision lens: investments toward future state
- Strategy lens: gaps between stated strategy and current product
- Customer lens: highest impact to most important user segments  
- Business lens: acquisition/engagement/monetization metric improvements
- Art = thoughtfully combining conflicting priorities from all 4 lenses

**Essential Dashboards**
- Minimum 3 dashboards: Acquisition, Engagement, Monetization
- Review daily/weekly to build intuition for natural metric fluctuations
- Mobile-accessible for constant monitoring

**Decision Communication**
- Share rationale, not just decisions - builds trust and enables future reversals
- Document rationales when possible (Square uses notes@square.com for broad distribution)
- Rationale sharing drives clarity of thought in decision-making process

**OKRs as Leadership Tool**
- Drives focus, alignment, accountability, outcome orientation
- Critical for resource allocation communication with senior leadership

## Bottom Line
Product management success requires treating each dimension (vision, strategy, design, execution) as concrete deliverables with specific frameworks rather than just performing associated activities.

# What Makes a Great Product Manager

**Source:** https://hackernoon.com/what-makes-a-great-product-manager-3c1d03b90356
**Section:** Product

---

## Key Insights

**Core Foundation:**
- Start with customer problems, not features - write the reviews you aspire users to write
- Build for yourself when possible - creates natural empathy and intuitive product sense
- Set shared, aspirational + realistic + quantifiable goals that teams fundamentally believe in

**Strategic Skills:**
- Use competitor products daily and share market context via teardowns/presentations
- Understand technical feasibility to create tight feedback loops between ideas and implementation
- Embrace constraints as creativity drivers - "open ended" paralyzed teams

**Execution Excellence:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly - force tradeoffs at right time, cut features for simpler customer experience
- Think in complete experiences/scenarios, not features when building MVPs
- Lead with action - prototype over debate, ask forgiveness not permission
- Operate at right "zoom level" - detailed when progress needed, big picture when perspective required

**Decision Making:**
- Strong point of view + weakly held - provides direction while enabling pivots with evidence
- Data-driven but not data-dependent - understand diminishing returns on analysis
- Simplify complex problems into key questions - consider audience need, not what you can show

**People & Process:**
- Seek mentors, mentor others - learning accelerator and viewpoint reinforcement
- Create leveraged materials fit-for-purpose - don't over-engineer specs when email works
- Give specific, useful feedback focused on product not person
- Share work early and often when change cost is low

## Bottom Line
Great product managers combine customer obsession with execution pragmatism - they start with why, embrace constraints, prioritize ruthlessly, and maintain strong opinions loosely held.

# accentuate-the-negative-making-the-non-perfect-decision-technica

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

- **Lead with tradeoffs, not features**: Start design reviews with "Here are the reasons I don't like my own plan" - lay out risks and disadvantages upfront before diving into details
- **Argue goals before solutions**: Get stakeholder alignment on priorities and acceptable tradeoffs first, before debating implementation details
- **Document dissent**: Encourage strong objectors to write "Supreme Court style" dissents that capture alternative viewpoints and reasoning for future reference
- **Use ADRs for context preservation**: Architectural Decision Records should explicitly capture why alternatives were rejected and what constraints drove decisions
- **Withholding negatives wastes time**: Hidden downsides lead to late-stage objections, rework, and misaligned expectations among stakeholders
- **Frame reviewers as teammates**: Position stakeholders as collaborators solving shared problems rather than opponents to convince
- **Call out non-obvious constraints early**: If accepting higher operational load for scalability or dropping support for edge cases, state this explicitly in review docs
- **Expect future judgment**: Today's "obvious" decisions will look questionable later when context changes - document the reasoning

## Bottom Line
Make better technical decisions by transparently presenting disadvantages upfront to stakeholders, enabling informed tradeoff discussions and building the context documentation that future teams will need.

## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiation changes at career stages**: Junior devs can "declare" their worth (difference between $70k and $90k candidate is just self-declaration), but plateau around $120k where negotiation becomes harder and management track opens up
- **Information asymmetry is key**: Companies know their budget ranges; candidates don't. Research Glassdoor, ask peers, never disclose previous salary to maintain leverage
- **$100k and $255k are critical thresholds**: Breaking $100k = experienced tier. $255k ceiling exists because it typically equals CEO base salary - companies resist paying employees more than CEO salary
- **High-end positions ($750k+) exist but require**: Domain expertise beyond coding, ability to translate business needs, niche experiences, direct networking with headhunters (not public job boards)
- **Exploding offers are manipulation**: Used to pressure inexperienced candidates. Always ask for reasonable time (few days minimum)
- **Always negotiate, even small amounts**: Companies budget salary ranges expecting negotiation. Asking for 10-20% more rarely kills offers but often succeeds
- **Multiple offers create leverage**: Only reliable negotiation tactic - companies respond to real competitive pressure, not hypothetical alternatives
- **Beyond base salary**: At higher levels, focus on ownership, bonuses, MBOs, and equity to break through salary caps
- **Stop disclosing previous compensation**: Say "competitive market rate" or cite employer confidentiality requirements

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation is a learnable skill with concrete thresholds and tactics, where information asymmetry heavily favors companies unless candidates actively research ranges and create competitive leverage through multiple offers.

# hackernews-discussion-2

**Section:** N/A

## Key Insights

**Salary Negotiation Evolution by Experience Level:**
- Junior devs: Difference between $70k and $90k candidate is simply declaring yourself as $90k candidate
- At $120k+ threshold: Can't just "declare" higher rates; need to prove value
- $255k appears to be key ceiling - requires ownership/bonuses beyond base salary to break through
- Average CEO salary caps at ~$255k, making it hard to justify paying employees more

**Negotiation Tactics:**
- Never disclose previous salary to third-party recruiters
- State compensation expectations upfront to avoid wasting time
- Use "competitive market rate" deflection when pressed for numbers
- Get multiple offers to create leverage - only effective strategy for high earners

**Market Dynamics:**
- $750k+ roles exist but bypass normal recruiting channels - require headhunters and niche expertise
- Big Tech (FAANG) only place where individual contributors can reach very high comp without management
- Startups become unviable for experienced developers due to comp limitations
- Assembly-line recruiting treats developers as commodities

**Strategic Approaches:**
- Treat job as B2B deal, not employment relationship
- Research salary bands beforehand using Glassdoor/network
- Walk away from "exploding offers" - red flag for company culture
- Negotiate total comp package, not just base salary
- Performance expectations often same regardless of 150k vs 200k salary

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation effectiveness plateaus around $120k-255k requiring different strategies (equity, bonuses, company switching) while junior developers can significantly boost pay simply by asking confidently.

# how-todays-fastest-growing-b2b-businesses-found-their-first-ten-

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

**Only 3 strategies drive early B2B customer acquisition (vs 7 for consumer):**
- Personal network (friends, former colleagues, investors, incubator peers)
- Going where customers are (communities, forums, events, door-to-door)
- Press coverage

**Personal network dominance:**
- Almost every B2B company uses BOTH network + customer hunting simultaneously
- Network especially critical for "sell-to" vs bottom-up products (trust factor)
- YC "Collison installation": Don't just ask for beta trial - grab their laptop and set it up immediately

**Specific sourcing examples:**
- Stripe: YC peers became first users, spread through word-of-mouth
- Figma: Used Twitter data to identify influential designers, cold emailed filtered list
- Square: Walked door-to-door to local merchants they could visit multiple times weekly
- New Relic: Targeted Ruby on Rails community (small but growing, high adoption rate)
- Salesforce: First customer was founder's portfolio company (favor + genuine need)

**Network building tactics:**
- Bring on connector investors
- Join incubators like YC for peer network
- Target 15-18 new prospects monthly via LinkedIn alumni networks
- Ask existing customers to evangelize through simple referral programs

**Press strategy nuances:**
- Launch coverage: Dropbox's Hacker News video, Twilio's TechCrunch rickroll
- Canva built 50k waitlist pre-launch through "stealth startup" press
- Press rarely primary acquisition channel - usually amplifies other efforts

## Bottom Line
B2B customer acquisition boils down to leveraging personal networks first, then systematically hunting prospects in their natural habitats, with press as amplification rather than primary driver.

# on-call-rotations-how-best-to-wake-devs-up-in-the-middle-of-the-

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

**Framework for Successful On-Call Rotations:**

- **Tip #1**: Every rotation needs an owner (usually manager) who knows about all wake-ups the next day and uses this data to prevent repeat issues
- **Tip #2**: Code is liability - best engineers work hardest to NOT write more code; use on-call time to fix within existing codebase
- **Tip #3**: Services need owners, not operators - devs on-call creates ownership vs "throwing over the wall"
- **Tip #4**: Use wake-up time strategically: answer support tickets, fix staging/CI, handle unreliable tests, security bounties
- **Tip #5**: Signal value through manager actions - remove yourself from rotation to provide backup, tell people to stay home after all-night incidents

**Operational Rules:**
- Use your SLA downtime budget: "If you haven't used your downtime, you aren't taking enough risks"
- Only page when "the world is on fire" - most issues don't require 3am wake-ups
- Never page new parents - "You should not have more than one thing waking you up"
- Team burnout happens faster than customer burnout

**Cultural Shifts:**
- Reframe as honor/privilege, not punishment
- Manager stays off rotation to provide support coverage
- Focus on sustainability through distributed knowledge
- Primary purpose: stop writing shit software and align infrastructure with DevOps

## Bottom Line

On-call rotations drive code quality and team ownership when structured with dedicated rotation owners, strategic use of wake-up time for maintenance tasks, and managers who model compassionate support rather than participate in rotations themselves.

# reverse-interviewing-how-to-interview-a-company-as-well-as-they-

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

**Timing**: Only conduct serious reverse interviews after you have the job offer negotiated - this is when you have power to ask uncomfortable questions without jeopardizing the opportunity

**Company Evaluation Bullseye Framework**: 
- Center: Non-negotiables (rigid, 100% requirements)
- Middle: Personal PMF (3-5 flexible pillars, company must score high on 3-4)
- Outer: Structured question themes (Culture, Strategy, Role, Goals, Communication)

**Critical Reverse Interview Questions**:
- Culture: "What characteristics define people who join but don't last long here?"
- Strategy: "What do I have to believe for you to reach $1B revenue?" 
- Role: "Why would I fail in this role?"
- Expectations: "What were you surprised by when you onboarded?"

**Back-channel Reference Red Flag**: If potential manager won't provide contacts of 3 people they managed directly, consider bowing out immediately

**Question Technique**: Don't accept general answers - dig deeper with "how" and demand specific examples, not hypotheticals

**Self-Discovery Process**: Use compounding questions + "Five Whys" technique:
- When was I happiest/miserable in career?
- What do I consider my best work?
- What makes me feel fulfilled?

**Back-channel Questions for Former Direct Reports**:
- Feedback style during success vs mistakes
- Goal-setting approach  
- What it took to get promoted under them

**Documentation**: Create table with themes as rows, questions and "who to ask" as columns - ask same question to multiple people to check consistency

## Bottom Line

Reverse interviewing after getting an offer and conducting thorough back-channel references are the highest-leverage activities for avoiding bad career moves and information asymmetry in hiring.

# strategic-procurements-10-commandments-for-managing-the-buying-p

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights
- Procurement departments use 10 standardized rules to control hospital buying processes and reduce supplier leverage
- Rule #1: All supplier contact must go through procurement first - they control vendor identification and sourcing
- Clinical staff should discuss only functional specs, never pricing, budgets, timelines, or preferences with vendors
- Product trials require procurement approval - they set parameters (dates, locations, patient types, evaluation criteria)
- Never reveal: budget amounts, purchase timelines, product preferences, or competing vendors to suppliers
- Procurement leverages timing (supplier's month/quarter/year-end) and information asymmetry for better pricing
- Trade-ins must be evaluated by procurement who understand asset depreciation and market values
- Revealing preferences makes suppliers negotiate harder on price; keeping them guessing leads to better offers
- These tactics specifically designed to counter suppliers' information-gathering strategies during sales processes
- Medicare cuts and quality penalties drive hospitals to empower procurement for "dramatic and ruthless" cost cutting

## Bottom Line
Hospital procurement departments systematically control all vendor interactions through 10 rigid rules designed to maximize their negotiating leverage while minimizing supplier influence over clinical staff.

# the-one-key-to-dealing-with-senior-executives-answer-the-questio

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

- Senior executives share 4 key traits: direct communication, fast pace, agenda control, and prepared question sequences
- Answer questions with numbers when possible ("7" vs. long explanations)
- Use simple hedging to provide threads for follow-up: "Yes, mostly" vs. disclaimers and caveats
- Bad answers waste time with filler, context, and excuses before getting to the point
- Best answer structure: Direct response + minimal qualifier that invites follow-up if needed
- Example framework:
  - Question: "Is project on time?"
  - Bad: Long explanation with risks/excuses
  - Good: "Yes, but server delivery holding us up"
  - Best: "Yes, mostly" (lets exec choose to dig deeper)
- Avoid presentations unless specifically requested - execs want to drive agenda
- Track question-answering patterns in meetings to identify how much time is wasted on non-answers
- Corporate meetings become "parallel independent conversations" when people don't answer questions and don't listen

## Bottom Line

Answer executive questions directly and concisely first, then provide minimal context only if it adds value or creates useful follow-up threads.

# the-secret-to-a-great-planning-process-lessons-from-airbnb-and-e

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

## Key Insights

**The W Framework - 4 Steps:**
- Context: Leadership shares high-level strategy with teams
- Plans: Teams respond with proposed execution plans 
- Integration: Leadership combines into single prioritized plan
- Buy-in: Teams provide feedback and commit to final plan

**Root cause of bad planning:** Unclear roles and responsibilities - who does what, when

**Leadership responsibilities:**
- Develop inspiring vision/strategy with concrete goals
- Make final prioritization and resource allocation decisions
- Share what they know AND what they don't know explicitly

**Team responsibilities:**
- Build execution plans supporting strategy
- Highlight gaps/risks in final plan
- Commit to goals with given resources

**Key planning principles:**
- Focus on 3-5 strategic pillars maximum (not dozens of priorities)
- 80% safe short-term bets, 20% risky long-term bets
- Plans get more complex in practice, never less - build in focus from start
- Cut good ideas that aren't perishable, strategic, or differentiating

**Critical success factors:**
- Single person takes first pass at strategy/plans (not committee)
- Teams must push back on Leadership direction - it's not written in stone
- Get buy-in from dependent teams before presenting to Leadership
- Share reasoning behind decisions, not just what was decided
- 5-10% of plan typically changes in final step

**Common failure modes:**
- Leadership too prescriptive or provides no context
- Teams work in silos without cross-team alignment
- Doing too much instead of focusing resources on fewer bets
- Skipping final buy-in step with team leaders

## Bottom Line
Most planning failures stem from unclear roles rather than bad strategy - the W Framework solves this by defining exactly who does what at each stage while balancing top-down vision with bottom-up execution expertise.

# the-single-most-important-internal-email-in-the-history-of-amazo

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

## Key Insights

**Bezos's API Mandate (2002)**
- All teams must expose data/functionality through service interfaces only
- No direct team communication except via network service calls
- All interfaces must be designed to be externally accessible from day one
- Violation = termination
- This mandate enabled AWS by forcing internal dogfooding and platform thinking

**Organization Structure Types**
- **Functional** (Apple): Organized by expertise, creates consistency but bureaucracy/slowness
- **Divisional** (Amazon): Organized by product, enables speed/innovation but creates inconsistency
- **Hybrid** (Netflix): "Highly aligned, loosely coupled" - debate strategy together, execute independently

**Communication Framework Spectrum**
- **Co-located Synchronous** (Apple): Traditional, highly coordinated but rigid, scales poorly
- **Co-located Asynchronous** (Amazon): Same location, API-like team interactions, limited meetings
- **Distributed Asynchronous**: No HQ, maximum autonomy, physical constraints become advantages
- **Distributed Synchronous** (InVision): No HQ but 4+ hour daily overlap in single timezone
- **Remote Asynchronous** (Basecamp): HQ exists but team distributed globally

**Key Principle**
- Asynchronous communication provides maximum optionality - everything that works async can work sync, but not vice versa
- Async requires more upfront investment in processes/documentation but scales logarithmically vs linear scaling of sync
- Conway's Law in action: communication structure directly shapes product architecture

## Bottom Line
Amazon's internal API mandate proves that changing communication infrastructure before organizational structure is the most powerful lever for architectural transformation.

# writing-user-stories-examples-and-templates-in-agile-methodologi

**Source:** N/A
**Section:** N/A

---

## Key Insights

**User Story Definition & Scope**
- User story = unit of work completable in one sprint (ideally ≤1 week)
- Keep stories in flat list structure; avoid nested hierarchies (harder to model on whiteboards)
- Epic = work requiring multiple sprints; Theme = collection of epics

**User Story Template**
- Format: "As a [type of user], I want [goal], so that [benefit/value]"
- Template forces three critical questions: Who (user), What (intention), Why (value)
- Bad example: "As a user, I am able to provide best support service to my customer" (too vague)

**Story Points & Estimation**
- Use Fibonacci numbers for relative complexity measurement
- Points don't equal time/effort, just relative sizing comparison
- Takes 5-10 sprints to master reliable estimation
- Team velocity should slowly increase over time

**INVEST Criteria for Quality Stories**
- Independent: Story stands alone
- Negotiable: Can be changed without breaking dependencies  
- Valuable: Provides end-user value
- Estimable: Size can be determined
- Small: Fits in one sprint
- Testable: Can be verified/tested

**Grooming Sessions**
- Run every 2 weeks during mid-sprint
- Timebox to 1 hour maximum
- Include senior technical members + business stakeholders
- Prioritize backlog beforehand; finalize acceptance criteria

**Story Characteristics**
- Must be user-centric (not system/component-focused)
- Should deliver standalone value when complete
- Group related stories into epics for better organization

## Bottom Line
Effective user stories require the INVEST framework, clear value articulation through the three-part template, and regular grooming sessions to maintain quality and team alignment.
