## Key Insights

**CTO Role Evolution Framework:**
- 2-4 engineers: Individual contributor focused on architecture and MVP
- 8-12 engineers: Critical breaking point where management processes become essential
- 18+ engineers: Full delegation required, focus shifts to organizational scaling

**CTO vs VP Engineering Decision:**
- CTO path: Technical architecture, domain expertise, direct code influence
- VP Engineering path: Process management, team scaling, organizational structure
- Founder advantage: Early employees more forgiving of management inexperience

**Key Transition Milestones:**
- Stop coding completely when you become the bottleneck for feature delivery
- Breaking points accelerate with distributed teams/multiple time zones
- On-call rotation should be implemented immediately after product-market fit

**Specific Scaling Data (RevenueCat):**
- 2018: 2 engineers, 1 time zone
- 2019: 4 engineers, 3 time zones  
- 2020: 8 engineers, 6 time zones
- 2021: 18 engineers, distributed globally

**Management Evolution:**
- Year 1: No formal process, weekly sprints
- Year 2: Monthly 1:1s, basic monitoring, founder on-call 24/7
- Year 3: Regular 1:1s, formal delegation, recruiting focus
- Year 4: Full organizational design, diversity hiring, junior engineer development

**Critical Realizations:**
- Founder dopamine should come from company success, not personal coding achievements
- Technical debt is beneficial during product-market fit phase
- Reducing bus factor more important than individual productivity
- Referral hiring works early but limits diversity at scale

## Bottom Line

Founder CTOs must transition from individual contributor to organizational architect around 8-12 engineers, prioritizing company needs over personal technical preferences while leveraging founder credibility to experiment with inexperienced management.
