## Key Insights

- **Lead with tradeoffs, not features**: Start design reviews with "Here are the reasons I don't like my own plan" - lay out risks and disadvantages upfront before diving into details
- **Argue goals before solutions**: Get stakeholder alignment on priorities and acceptable tradeoffs first, before debating implementation details
- **Document dissent**: Encourage strong objectors to write "Supreme Court style" dissents that capture alternative viewpoints and reasoning for future reference
- **Use ADRs for context preservation**: Architectural Decision Records should explicitly capture why alternatives were rejected and what constraints drove decisions
- **Withholding negatives wastes time**: Hidden downsides lead to late-stage objections, rework, and misaligned expectations among stakeholders
- **Frame reviewers as teammates**: Position stakeholders as collaborators solving shared problems rather than opponents to convince
- **Call out non-obvious constraints early**: If accepting higher operational load for scalability or dropping support for edge cases, state this explicitly in review docs
- **Expect future judgment**: Today's "obvious" decisions will look questionable later when context changes - document the reasoning

## Bottom Line
Make better technical decisions by transparently presenting disadvantages upfront to stakeholders, enabling informed tradeoff discussions and building the context documentation that future teams will need.
