## Key Insights

- **Constrain yourself deliberately**: Unlimited freedom depletes creative energy. Pick one narrow slice of the problem (e.g., "hats for bearded guys") and focus all energy there
- **Generate 20+ ideas minimum**: Write your first idea, then consider it "not good enough" and force yourself to create 20 more before choosing
- **Apply the 3-filter test**: Does it move the needle? Will anyone care? Can it impact 1,000+ people?
- **Use the "boardroom test"**: If corporate executives wouldn't give you weird looks, you're not thinking creatively enough
- **Hold workshops outside the office**: Different environment breaks typical thought patterns; office settings kill creative flow
- **Feed your brain more inputs**: Creativity = recombining existing ideas, so consume more diverse sources (use Awwwards, CSS Design Awards for UX inspiration)
- **Write goals in big letters first**: Keeps you anchored to core framework while ideating
- **Choose your craziest viable idea**: Your most uncomfortable concepts are often your best; comfort zone = creative death zone
- **Get explicit permission to be crazy**: From stakeholders and yourself; fear of rejection kills big ideas
- **Set up your creative environment**: Most people need positive mood + personal optimal conditions (alone/with audience, music, etc.)

## Bottom Line
Creative thinking requires structured constraints, high-volume ideation (20+ ideas), and deliberately choosing the most uncomfortable viable option.
