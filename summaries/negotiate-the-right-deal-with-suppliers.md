## Key Insights

- Define negotiation priorities beyond price: delivery times, payment terms, quality, lifetime costs, after-sales service, and business criticality
- Research supplier's market position: monopolies have upper hand, new entrants/competitors give you leverage
- Assess your value to supplier: if you're their main customer, you have considerable leverage but risk damaging service quality if you push too hard
- Time negotiations strategically: target salespeople near monthly quota deadlines
- Match negotiating team seniority to supplier's representatives
- Never accept first offer - make low counter-offer and ask what else they can include at given price
- For artificially high "permanently discounted" prices, negotiate beyond standard discount levels
- Expose ongoing costs (repairs, consumables) to make asking price appear high
- Credit check suppliers before long-term contracts, especially single-source providers
- Get references from other customers, but remember suppliers won't provide dissatisfied clients
- Include specific contract clauses: ownership retention until full payment, liability limitations, delivery penalties, dispute resolution procedures
- Build in after-sales service requirements and failure remedies (individual vs. batch replacement, timeframes)

## Bottom Line

Successful supplier negotiations require balancing short-term gains with long-term relationship value while leveraging your market research and bargaining power strategically.
