## Key Insights

**Hiring & Retention:**
- Hire senior leaders first - junior hires get lost without mentorship
- Replace take-home coding challenges with 1-hour in-person sessions with experienced data scientists
- Half of data scientists stay <2 years - reduce turnover by being realistic about role pain points upfront
- Break overwhelming projects into manageable chunks to prevent intimidation
- Create learning opportunities (weekly research lunches, hackathons) since boredom drives turnover

**Management Framework - 7 Habits:**
- Force data scientists to attend meetings without laptops to improve stakeholder communication
- Use templates to track 1-on-1 discussions, objectives, and feedback
- Train teams to deploy their own APIs to avoid engineering bottlenecks
- Implement weekly on-call rotation as teams scale to encourage better documentation
- New managers should stop coding for 3-6 months to fully embrace the role

**Knowledge Management System Requirements:**
- Must enable discovery, provenance, reuse, and modularity in one platform
- Only 20% of computational research code can be re-run successfully
- Organize around "models" as the unit of knowledge (includes data, code, parameters, results)
- Test discovery efficiency: time new hires finding artifacts (weeks/months = red flag)
- Test reuse: have new hire reproduce 6-month-old work (week+ duration = problem)

**Scaling Metrics:**
- Ask 5 data scientists separately how many projects the team is doing - different answers indicate coordination problems

## Bottom Line
Success requires hiring senior talent first, implementing systematic knowledge management around models as the core unit, and forcing better communication through process changes rather than relying on individual initiative.
