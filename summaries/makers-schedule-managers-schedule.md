# Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule

## Key Insights

- **Two schedule types**: Manager's schedule (1-hour blocks, constant task switching) vs. Maker's schedule (half-day minimum chunks for deep work)
- **Meeting cost differential**: For managers, meetings are low-cost slot-filling; for makers, one meeting can destroy an entire day's productivity
- **Cascading effect**: Knowing about an afternoon meeting reduces morning ambition - makers avoid starting complex tasks when interruption looms
- **Power imbalance**: Most executives operate on manager's schedule and can force their rhythm on makers, but smart ones restrain themselves
- **Office hours solution**: Cluster all meetings at day's end to simulate manager's schedule within maker's framework - prevents interruption of deep work blocks
- **Time partitioning hack**: Split day into two workdays - one for "business stuff" (manager mode) and one for creating (maker mode, often late night when interruptions impossible)
- **Speculative meetings**: "Grab coffee" meetings are essentially free for managers but catastrophically expensive for makers
- **Communication gap**: Most people assume everyone runs on manager's schedule, creating bind where makers must choose between productivity loss or relationship damage

## Frameworks
- **Office hours clustering**: Batch all meetings at day's end
- **Dual workday split**: Separate creation time from administrative time completely

## Bottom Line
Understanding the fundamental incompatibility between manager's hourly scheduling and maker's deep-work blocks is crucial for protecting team productivity and avoiding costly interruptions to creative work.
