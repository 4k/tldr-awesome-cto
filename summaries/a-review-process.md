## Key Insights

**Review Structure Framework:**
- Use organizational values (Leadership Principles) as evaluation rubric instead of role-specific skills
- Two-question format: "What 1-2 principles has this person embodied?" and "What 1-2 should they focus on?" with specific examples required
- Eliminates blank-page paralysis and vague feedback like "great to work with"

**Non-Anonymous Peer Reviews:**
- Managers compile all peer feedback with names attached in single Google Doc
- Manager acts as editor to check tone/ask for specifics before sharing
- Results in more meaningful feedback (people don't want colleagues seeing lazy one-liners)
- Enables direct peer-to-peer follow-up conversations post-review

**Level Calibration Process:**
- Create spreadsheet with role categories for each person
- Employee self-rates skill levels, manager rates separately
- Combine sheets and highlight discrepancies for discussion
- Reveals gaps in role documentation and creates alignment on performance expectations
- Common outcome: managers rate people higher than self-ratings

**Implementation Details:**
- Send reviews 1-2 days before conversation so reviewee can prepare
- Start review meetings with "What were the highlights? Any surprises?"
- Quarterly reduced to bi-annual frequency
- Process drives people to proactively seek clarification from peers

**Process Evolution:**
- Annual iteration on role documentation after review cycles
- Regular feedback collection through surveys and 1:1s
- Leadership Principles updated based on team input

## Bottom Line
Replace anonymous peer reviews with named feedback using organizational values as rubric, creating a calibration process that drives direct peer conversations and genuine performance alignment.
