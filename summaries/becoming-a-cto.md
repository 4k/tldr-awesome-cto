## Key Insights

- CTO role is primarily communication and leadership, not coding - protect tech team from becoming "pure execution arm" for others' ideas
- Must have absolute authority over technical decisions - if you need to "sell" unit testing to the board, you're not a CTO but a lead engineer in a suit
- Business knowledge is #1 requirement - all technical decisions must align with business needs and customer value, not exist in isolation
- Apply 80-20 rule to technology investments - find solutions delivering 80% return with 20% cost
- Avoid the rewrite trap - legacy systems become expensive but rewrites "almost always deliver zero value to the customer"
- Focus on reliability and security as top priorities when evaluating business changes
- Create welcoming environment for developers (approve TDD, pair programming, staging servers as needed) since hiring is the biggest challenge
- Technology should be invisible to users - debates about specific languages/frameworks are irrelevant to organizational success
- Balance advancing infrastructure with maintaining existing systems - building teams that only want newest tech is unsustainable
- Role requires comfort with meetings, non-technical stakeholders, and business strategy discussions

## Bottom Line
A CTO's job is defining technology vision and strategy while protecting the dev team's autonomy, not writing code or debating which programming languages are better.
