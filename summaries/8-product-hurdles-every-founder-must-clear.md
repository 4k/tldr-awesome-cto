## Key Insights

**Customer Discovery & Market Validation:**
- Use cold outreach, never friends/network for validation - if strangers won't spend time, your idea isn't worth pursuing
- Apply outcome-driven innovation: collect 20-40 customer outcomes, measure importance vs satisfaction - unsatisfied+important = opportunity
- Focus on underserved segments within crowded markets, not new categories
- Validate customer/problem fit before product/market fit - measure problem severity and interest in solving it

**MVP & Early Product:**
- Build only what you can't do manually - everything else should be high-touch service initially
- Sprig's first version was just an SDK; founder personally built analysis decks and managed all configurations
- Manual approach validates core value before expensive automation

**Customer Conversations:**
- Treat feedback calls like awkward 1:1s with direct reports
- Key questions: "0-10 satisfaction with our company, what gets you to 10?" and "What feature wouldn't you miss if removed?"
- Invalidate ideas quickly - better to kill after weeks than 18 months of development

**Founder-Led Sales:**
- Submarine technique: start each meeting by stating the small decision needed at the end (not a big purchase decision)
- Document your evolving playbook in Google Docs after every call
- Let product do the selling - offer trials before discussing pricing
- Need repeatable ICP + repeatable process before hiring sales team

**Product Expansion:**
- Stay within your category (per G2 definitions) - spanning categories dilutes offering
- Look at other tools customers use alongside yours for adjacent opportunities
- Follow 8-step customer job flow to find gaps you don't solve yet

## Bottom Line
Focus on underserved segments within existing categories, validate through cold outreach, build manually first, ask brutally honest questions, and expand within your category rather than across categories.
