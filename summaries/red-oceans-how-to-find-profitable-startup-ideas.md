## Key Insights

**Internal Approach (Skills-Based):**
- 43% of entrepreneurs get ideas from same-industry experience - highest single source
- "Entrepreneurship by braille" - only pursuing what you know/like - limits opportunity scope
- Best ideas grow "organically" from founder expertise hitting external market stimulus

**External Approach (Market-First) Methods:**

**Market-Area Saturation Analysis:**
- Formula: (State establishments of type X ÷ state population) × target area population = expected number needed
- Example: 100K people should support 11.3 pizza places, 4.0 gyms, 1.0 bowling alley based on state averages
- Use Google Maps + census data to identify geographic gaps

**Competitive Matrix Framework:**
- Rate competitor performance vs. customer importance (1-5 scale) for each factor
- Gap of 1 point = small opportunity (competitors can adapt)
- Gap of 2+ points = significant exploitable opportunity
- Survey target segment for importance ratings, evaluate current providers

**Industry Growth Targeting:**
- Use IBIS Industry Reports, SageWorks for growth rates
- 2018 fastest growing: Marijuana retail (40.2%), Wind turbines (48.8%)
- Target industries growing 10-20x faster than overall economy

**Matrix Charting Systematic Search:**
- Grid: Product elements (vertical) × questions (horizontal): What/Where/Who/When/How can it be used?
- Fill boxes methodically to uncover gaps

**Slice of Life Decision Tree:**
- Divide life experiences in half repeatedly until reaching discrete problem areas
- Analyze each slice for specific pain points during that timeframe/activity

## Bottom Line
Red Ocean opportunities in established markets offer more reliable paths to profitable businesses than Blue Ocean innovation, using systematic gap analysis methods to find underserved demand.
