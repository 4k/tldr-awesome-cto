## Key Insights

**Value Articulation Framework:**
- Articulate values when you have 20-40 employees - not too early (3 people) or late (500+ people)
- Define values across 3 Ps: People (hiring/firing decisions), Product (features/customer treatment), Process (decision-making/accountability)
- Convene diverse group of 12, collect 100+ ideas, consolidate to 25, then apply "Oxygen Test" - keep only what you can't live without
- Use verbs, not adjectives - make them actionable commands under 5 words
- CEO leads but must include the tribe - values belong to everyone, not just leadership

**Living Values Daily:**
- Hire for capacity to live values, not perfect exhibition of them
- "Salt shaker principle" - staff will constantly move values off-center, your job is to consistently move them back without anger
- Fire incapable performers regardless of results; coach capable non-performers back to center
- Values are working when heard in hallways, board meetings, and noticed by outsiders
- Monitor unexpected interpretations - people will build from values in ways you never imagined

**Value Evolution:**
- Change values every few years maximum - quarterly changes make them strategies, not values
- Company may resist changes even when leadership sees need - respect tribal ownership
- Expect values to need refinement as company, product, and leadership mature

## Bottom Line
Values must be actionable verbs that guide daily decisions across people/product/process, lived consistently by leadership, and evolved carefully with tribal buy-in rather than top-down mandate.
