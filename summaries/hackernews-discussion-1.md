## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiation changes at career stages**: Junior devs can "declare" their worth (difference between $70k and $90k candidate is just self-declaration), but plateau around $120k where negotiation becomes harder and management track opens up
- **Information asymmetry is key**: Companies know their budget ranges; candidates don't. Research Glassdoor, ask peers, never disclose previous salary to maintain leverage
- **$100k and $255k are critical thresholds**: Breaking $100k = experienced tier. $255k ceiling exists because it typically equals CEO base salary - companies resist paying employees more than CEO salary
- **High-end positions ($750k+) exist but require**: Domain expertise beyond coding, ability to translate business needs, niche experiences, direct networking with headhunters (not public job boards)
- **Exploding offers are manipulation**: Used to pressure inexperienced candidates. Always ask for reasonable time (few days minimum)
- **Always negotiate, even small amounts**: Companies budget salary ranges expecting negotiation. Asking for 10-20% more rarely kills offers but often succeeds
- **Multiple offers create leverage**: Only reliable negotiation tactic - companies respond to real competitive pressure, not hypothetical alternatives
- **Beyond base salary**: At higher levels, focus on ownership, bonuses, MBOs, and equity to break through salary caps
- **Stop disclosing previous compensation**: Say "competitive market rate" or cite employer confidentiality requirements

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation is a learnable skill with concrete thresholds and tactics, where information asymmetry heavily favors companies unless candidates actively research ranges and create competitive leverage through multiple offers.
