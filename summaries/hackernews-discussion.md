## Key Insights

- **Salary negotiation effectiveness changes with experience level**:
  - Junior devs: Difference between $70k and $90k candidate is simply declaring yourself as $90k candidate
  - Senior devs ($120k+): Harder to jump from $140k to $180k; often pushed toward management roles
  - $255k appears to be a ceiling outside Big Tech (tied to average CEO salary caps)

- **Information asymmetry is critical**:
  - Companies know their budget ranges; candidates don't
  - Stop disclosing previous salary to recruiters/employers
  - Research compensation via Glassdoor, network contacts before interviewing
  - Script: "My employer asked me to keep compensation confidential"

- **High earners ($750k+) use different channels**:
  - Don't go through standard recruiters or job boards
  - Work with specialized headhunters for niche roles
  - Possess domain expertise beyond just programming skills
  - Can translate technical skills into direct business value

- **Negotiation power comes from alternatives**:
  - Having multiple offers is the strongest negotiation position
  - Without alternatives, you have limited leverage
  - Geographic markets vary significantly in opportunity density

- **Timing and process matter**:
  - Establish salary ranges upfront to avoid wasted time
  - Beware "exploding offers" (especially targeting junior developers)
  - Take time to consider offers; don't decide on the spot

- **Company perspective shifts outcome**:
  - Treat as ongoing relationship, not one-time transaction
  - Managers often care little about your exact salary once hired
  - Higher negotiated salary can improve performance (better commute, less financial stress)

## Bottom Line

Salary negotiation becomes fundamentally different at higher experience levels, requiring market research, multiple offers, and specialized channels rather than just declaring higher numbers.
