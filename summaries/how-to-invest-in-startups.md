## Key Insights

**Access to deals:**
- Most investors don't work hard - exploit this by outworking them
- Instead of asking for deal flow, offer to work 1 day/week helping contacts' best companies
- Build brand through long-form content (few do well) vs tweeting (everyone does)
- Focus on helping other respected investors and good founders

**Decision-making framework:**
- Ask: "Would I work for this person?" and "Can I imagine them taking over their industry?"
- Rate of improvement matters more than current ability - meet founders 3x in 3 months, look for detectable progress each time
- Fast email response correlation: "Almost never made money investing in founders who don't respond quickly to important emails"
- Only invest in potential $10B+ companies due to power law dynamics
- Focus on market growth rate and eventual size, not current market size

**Key founder traits:**
- Scrappy + formidable (rare combination)
- Fast movers (hard to change personality trait)
- Mission-oriented, relentless, high-conviction
- Believe they are "eventually certain to be successful"

**Best company characteristics checklist:**
- Compelling founders
- Mission that attracts talent
- Product people spontaneously tell friends about
- Rapidly growing market
- Network effects + low marginal costs
- 10x better than existing options or fundamentally new

**Closing tactics:**
- Decide quickly before other investors
- Treat founders as peers, not subordinates
- Build reputation for being "above-and-beyond helpful"

**Helping portfolio companies:**
- Primary goal: make founders more ambitious with bigger self-belief
- Give specific tactical advice, not general strategy
- Most "vague help" requests are really asking for emotional support

## Bottom Line
Startup investing success requires outworking competitors for deal access, betting only on potential $10B+ companies with fast-improving founders, and treating those founders as peers while providing tactical support.
