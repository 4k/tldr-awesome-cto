## Key Insights

**Hiring Decision Framework:**
- Only 2 outcomes: Hire or No Hire. Never "maybe," "hire but not for my team," or "I can't tell"
- If you're on the fence = No Hire. If you can't tell = No Hire
- Better to reject a good candidate than accept a bad one
- Require 6 interviewers minimum, 5 must be peers. If 2+ say no = don't hire
- Make decision within 3 minutes of interview ending, submit feedback within 15 minutes

**Core Criteria (Only Two Things Matter):**
- Smart: Can handle multiple levels of abstraction, explains things clearly, shows passion
- Gets Things Done: Historical evidence of overcoming obstacles and delivering results

**Interview Structure (1 hour minimum):**
1. Introduction (30 seconds)
2. Open-ended project questions (look for passion, clear explanation, leadership)
3. Easy programming question (filters out pretenders)
4. Pointer/recursion question (tests abstraction ability)
5. "Are you satisfied with that code?" (tests debugging)
6. Candidate questions + selling

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Don't research candidate beforehand - creates bias
- No trivia questions ("varchar vs varchar2 in Oracle")
- No brain teasers or "aha!" questions
- No illegal questions (demographics, military, family)
- Don't let one person interview multiple candidates simultaneously

**Technical Testing:**
- Pointers/recursion separate good programmers from script jockeys
- Speed on simple problems predicts advanced capability
- 20% hire rate from live interviews indicates good screening

## Bottom Line
Use exactly 2 criteria (smart + gets things done), require 6 interviewers, default to "no hire" for any uncertainty, and test programming fundamentals that reveal ability to handle abstraction.
