## Key Insights
- Tech layoffs in 2022 tracked by multiple sites (Crunchbase, Inc42, trueup.io) - phenomenon widespread enough to require dedicated tracking
- Major cuts: Meta (first in 20-year history), Twitter (50% workforce + contractors), Byju's (2,500 employees, 5% of workforce), Peloton (staged cuts throughout year)
- Two primary drivers: economic uncertainty (external) and poor performance (internal)
- Goldman Sachs: Higher interest rates disproportionately impact tech because profits expected further out = greater duration risk
- Contributing factors: shrinking ad budgets, crypto market collapse
- Tech jobs = <3% of total US employment, limiting broader economic impact
- Tech workers have high likelihood of securing new jobs quickly
- US unemployment near 50-year low despite tech layoffs
- Employers avoid holiday season layoffs - December already showed 7,600 more cuts in first week
- Layoffs not US-exclusive: India's tech sector also cutting (Byju's example)

## Bottom Line
Tech layoffs in 2022 represented sector-specific adjustments to economic conditions rather than broader economic distress, with cuts concentrated in companies facing duration risk from higher rates and reduced ad spending.
