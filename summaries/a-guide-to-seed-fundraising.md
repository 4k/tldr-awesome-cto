## Key Insights

**When to Raise:**
- Wait until you have product-market fit with 10% weekly growth for several weeks
- Only raise when you can tell a compelling story: great product, right team, large opportunity
- Rule: when you can raise money, you should raise money

**How Much to Raise:**
- Engineer costs ~$15k/month all-in (rule of thumb for budgeting)
- Target 12-18 months of runway to next fundable milestone
- Aim for 10% dilution (ideal), max 25% dilution
- Seed rounds typically $500k-$1.5M, clustering around $600k

**Financing Structure:**
- Most seed rounds now use SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or convertible notes
- Equity rounds are rare for seed due to complexity/cost
- Use standard documents (YC's SAFE) - well-understood by investors

**Valuation Benchmarks:**
- Seed valuations typically range $2M-$10M
- Don't over-optimize valuation - getting the deal matters more than maximizing price
- Let market set your price through investor competition

**Investor Strategy:**
- Angels: faster decisions, more emotional, invest own money
- VCs: longer process, multiple partners, see many deals
- Focus on investors most likely to close first - momentum builds after first money in
- Goal in first meeting: get next meeting, not close the deal

**Pitch Essentials:**
- Executive summary: 1-2 pages max covering vision, product, team, traction, market size
- Demo almost always required
- Get investor talking more than you = higher deal probability
- Always end with clear next steps or attempted close

**Process Rules:**
- First money is hardest - focus efforts there
- Once someone says yes, close immediately (handshake protocol)
- Don't negotiate in real-time - take requests away for consideration
- Standard closing should take minutes with proper documents

## Bottom Line
Raise money when you have 10% weekly growth and can tell a compelling story, target 12-18 months runway with standard SAFEs, and optimize for speed over valuation since first money creates momentum for subsequent closes.
