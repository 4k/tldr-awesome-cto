## Key Insights

**Three Types of Teams:**
- Delivery teams: "Backlog administrators" running SAFe/Scrum with product owners doing administrative work (repackaged waterfall)
- Feature teams: Cross-functional but serve predefined roadmaps, focused on output delivery
- Product teams: Empowered, outcome-focused, solve problems vs deliver features

**Four Core Product Risks:**
- Value risk (will people buy/use it?)
- Usability risk (can users figure it out?)
- Feasibility risk (can we build it?)
- Business viability risk (works for our business?)

**Role Responsibility Split:**
- Product teams: PM owns value + viability, designer owns usability, tech lead owns feasibility
- Feature teams: Stakeholders own value + viability decisions, team just executes

**Feature Team Problems:**
- Can't attract/retain true product designers (end up with graphic designers)
- PM becomes project manager + unskilled designer hybrid
- Engineers relegated to delivery (losing half their value)
- Role confusion between PM and designer common
- Good talent leaves for empowered teams

**Feature Team Diagnostic Tests:**
- Given roadmaps with features/dates vs problems to solve?
- Role confusion with designer/delivery manager?
- Spend most time on project management?
- OKRs implementation was messy?
- Team acts like mercenaries vs missionaries?

**Critical Distinction:**
- Feature team PMs facilitate delivery; product team PMs need deep customer/business knowledge and ensure value/viability
- Same title, completely different skillsets required

## Bottom Line
Most "product teams" are actually feature teams executing predefined roadmaps, which wastes talent and delivers poor results compared to truly empowered product teams that own outcomes and solve problems.
