## Key Insights

**Framework Structure:**
- 2 tracks (Individual Contributor, Manager) × 5 levels = 10 distinct roles
- 5 shared KPIs across all roles: Product, Technology, People, Process, Area of Impact
- Each KPI has 5 steps with increasing expectations by level

**Promotion Philosophy:**
- Promotions are descriptive, not prescriptive - promote after demonstrating next-level performance
- "5 C's" criteria: Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent, Competency at next level
- New responsibilities come first, recognition follows

**Key Role Transitions:**
- Junior → Software Engineer: Move from individual focus to team impact
- Senior → Principal/Staff: Split into technical mastery (Principal) vs cross-team coordination (Staff)
- Level V: Chapter Lead focuses on community impact, Engineering Manager on people management

**Evaluation Scale:**
- 4-point scale from "does not meet" to "exceeds most expectations"
- Examples are illustrative, not prescriptive checklists

**Scaling Triggers for Framework Redesign:**
- Team growth: 5 → 20+ engineers over 4 years
- Structure shift: Functional silos → cross-functional teams
- Metrics evolution: Quantitative KPIs (velocity) → qualitative KPIs (impact)

**Framework Sources:**
- Analyzed 19 company frameworks (Spotify, Medium, Buffer, etc.) before customizing
- Framework must address company-specific needs, not copy-paste from others

## Bottom Line
A promotion framework works best when it uses consistent KPIs across all levels, promotes based on demonstrated performance rather than promises, and evolves with company structure and values.
