## Key Insights

**The Power Imbalance**
- 90% of interview time focuses on company evaluating you, only 10% for your questions
- Short-term job hops damage resumes; companies screen for this pattern
- Company success impacts your career trajectory more than most realize - fast-growing companies create promotion opportunities through need + capability

**5-Step Reverse Interview Framework**
1. Self + peer assessment of strengths/weaknesses
2. Define what you want from next role
3. Identify companies that match criteria
4. Get insider information to filter options
5. Come more prepared than they do

**High-Impact Question Techniques**
- Give context that shapes their perception: "I connect my work to strategic picture, so..."
- Ask for specific examples: "What have you chosen NOT to do because of this strategy?"
- Recast understanding back to deepen discussion
- Use follow-ups: "Can you tell me more about X?" "Do you have an example?"

**Critical Areas to Probe**
- Role autonomy: "What decisions do I make alone vs. with input?"
- Team structure: "How is this team organized within broader company?"
- Role progression: "Who succeeded in this role? What capabilities did they show?"
- Company perception: "What's the biggest risk you'd take hiring me?"

**Tactical Execution**
- Evaluate company, team, AND role together - don't over-focus on one
- Early-stage companies: prioritize company/team evaluation
- Later-stage companies: focus on personal fit
- Always ask for more time if needed during "sell" stage
- Back-channel them like they back-channel you
- Interview success = 50% marketing, 50% capabilities (not 10/90)

## Bottom Line
Career decisions are high-stakes with asymmetric risk, so flip the script by coming more prepared than your interviewer and asking questions that reveal reality behind their sales pitch.
