## Key Insights

**Understanding Your Manager**
- Always align on two key questions: "What is success for me personally?" and "What is success for my manager's team?" - revisit these as company goals pivot
- Identify what signal your manager uses to determine trust (peer validation, metrics, testimonials) and tap into those mechanisms
- Focus on your manager's most urgent priorities and adjust accordingly - if you're not top of stack, do great work quietly until you are
- Propose solutions that solve both your problems AND your boss's problems one level up

**Communication Tactics**
- Use "rule of seven dippings" - complex ideas need multiple exposures over time before being internalized
- Observe how your manager listens and adjust delivery accordingly (e.g., lead with solution before problem if they race to find fixes)
- For micro-managers: provide comprehensive updates staying steps ahead; for hands-off managers: use 15% wins, 85% challenges ratio
- Separate general updates from specific requests - requests should be shorter and extremely clear on what you need

**Making Asks**
- Leave breadcrumb trails for big requests rather than saving everything for one perfect presentation
- Come with 2-3 options in table format showing lift, resources, pros/cons, and stakeholders needed
- Create shared understanding of constraints, unknowns, and alternative paths before proposing solutions

**1:1 Structure**
- Use shared doc with sections: FYIs, updates from both sides, follow-ups, discussion topics
- Start with bird's eye view of all projects before diving deep on any topic
- Grade yourself on alignment after each meeting - if consistently surprised, you need more signal throughout the week

**Self-Advocacy**
- Send weekly "State of Me" email with current priorities, things on your mind, and blockers needing help
- Create self-service status updates that managers can access asynchronously
- Use "FYI, no action" emails scheduled for convenient reading times

**Relationship Building**
- Don't seek to please your boss - push back when it's in company's best interest
- When given new tasks, respond with "Here's all my other priorities - where does this fall?"
- Train your manager on boundaries through actions, not explicit statements

## Bottom Line
Managing up is an ongoing investment in radical empathy - understand your manager's priorities, constraints, and communication style, then proactively provide the information they need in the format they best receive it.
