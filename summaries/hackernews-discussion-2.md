## Key Insights

**Salary Negotiation Evolution by Experience Level:**
- Junior devs: Difference between $70k and $90k candidate is simply declaring yourself as $90k candidate
- At $120k+ threshold: Can't just "declare" higher rates; need to prove value
- $255k appears to be key ceiling - requires ownership/bonuses beyond base salary to break through
- Average CEO salary caps at ~$255k, making it hard to justify paying employees more

**Negotiation Tactics:**
- Never disclose previous salary to third-party recruiters
- State compensation expectations upfront to avoid wasting time
- Use "competitive market rate" deflection when pressed for numbers
- Get multiple offers to create leverage - only effective strategy for high earners

**Market Dynamics:**
- $750k+ roles exist but bypass normal recruiting channels - require headhunters and niche expertise
- Big Tech (FAANG) only place where individual contributors can reach very high comp without management
- Startups become unviable for experienced developers due to comp limitations
- Assembly-line recruiting treats developers as commodities

**Strategic Approaches:**
- Treat job as B2B deal, not employment relationship
- Research salary bands beforehand using Glassdoor/network
- Walk away from "exploding offers" - red flag for company culture
- Negotiate total comp package, not just base salary
- Performance expectations often same regardless of 150k vs 200k salary

## Bottom Line
Salary negotiation effectiveness plateaus around $120k-255k requiring different strategies (equity, bonuses, company switching) while junior developers can significantly boost pay simply by asking confidently.
