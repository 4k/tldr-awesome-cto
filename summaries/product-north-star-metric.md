## Key Insights

**North Star Metric Structure:**
- Must combine: product vision statement + measurable metric
- Should capture customer "aha moment" - early actions that lead to retention
- Must be leading indicator, not lagging (avoid monthly revenue, ARPU)
- Gets you closest to actual customer value impact

**Three Business Game Types:**
1. Attention Game: Time spent in product (Facebook, Netflix)
2. Transaction Game: Number of transactions (Amazon, Walmart) 
3. Productivity Game: Work efficiency (Salesforce, Adobe)

**Proven Examples:**
- Facebook: "# users adding 7 friends in first 10 days"
- Fortune 100 retailer: "mobile orders delivered" 
- SaaS trial: "trial accounts with >3 users active in week 1"

**Input Framework Pattern:**
- Use 3-5 inputs following breadth, depth, frequency, efficiency dimensions
- Each team maps their work to specific inputs affecting the North Star

**One Metric Rule:**
- Single P&L/product team = one North Star maximum
- Prevents diluted focus and conflicting priorities
- Enables clear trade-off decisions across organization

**Selection Process:**
- First identify which of the 3 games your business plays
- Find metric closest to customer value realization
- Ensure it's predictive of future revenue, not historical

## Bottom Line

A North Star Metric must capture customer value through leading indicators tied to one of three business games (attention, transaction, productivity), with 3-5 measurable inputs that teams can directly influence through product decisions.
