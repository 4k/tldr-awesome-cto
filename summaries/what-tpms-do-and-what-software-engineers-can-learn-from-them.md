## Key Insights

**TPM Value Proposition:**
- TPMs are "force multipliers on a different level" - can make difference between 6-month smooth delivery vs 2-year departmental chokeup
- DoorDash ratio: 15 TPMs for ~1,000 tech people; Uber: 70 TPMs for 4,000 tech org
- TPMs own "when?" and "who?" questions while PMs own "why/what?" and EMs own "how?"

**Core TPM Responsibilities:**
- Lead complex, multi-team projects (GDPR implementation, mobile app rewrites)
- Own engineering programs that aren't products (cloud migrations, tech debt)
- Drive engineering delivery for domains (mobile, frontend, infrastructure)
- Manage engineering brand, strategy, and top-level OKRs
- Handle engineering processes (release management, incident response)

**TPM Career Paths:**
- No single path - "uncommon" backgrounds are common
- Easier to transition internally at current company than externally
- Common transitions: project managers, EMs, business program managers, software engineers, product managers

**Working Effectively with TPMs:**
- Treat as partnership, not project management
- Invest time getting TPMs up to speed on technology and constraints
- TPMs should understand engineering reality to push in right areas
- Best for projects with multiple teams, not single-team efforts

**Key TPM Skills Engineers Can Learn:**
- Cross-organizational influence and communication
- Managing up to directors/VPs level
- Breadth perspective across organization
- Leading cross-team projects and conflict resolution

## Bottom Line
TPMs are specialized force multipliers who coordinate complex, multi-team engineering initiatives, and their core skills around cross-organizational influence and project orchestration are increasingly valuable for senior engineers.
