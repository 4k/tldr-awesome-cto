## Key Insights

- **Management = Complete Career Reset**: New managers are shocked by initial incompetence - 1:1s, organizational navigation, process creation, and constant scrutiny are entirely different skills from technical craft
- **Contributor Track Limitations**: 99.9% of VP/Director-level roles require management; contributor advancement is exponentially harder due to need-based manager role creation vs. limited senior IC positions
- **Pay/Authority Gap**: Despite company claims of "parallel tracks," contributors cannot achieve same compensation and influence as managers at equivalent levels
- **Accountability Filter**: Core decision criterion should be desire for accountability - successful managers want to be "on the hook" when things go wrong, not just when they go right
- **Peter Principle Prevention**: Each management level (IC→Manager→Director→VP) requires fundamentally different skills; promotions fail when people take roles they don't want accountability for
- **Readiness Paradox**: Caring about doing a good job is the strongest predictor of management success; those who worry about preparedness perform best because they seek feedback and learn fastest
- **No Preparation Substitute**: Direct experience is the only real training for people management - theoretical preparation has limited value
- **Reversibility Safety Net**: Management isn't permanent - technical expertise doesn't disappear, and returning to IC roles is common and acceptable

## Bottom Line
Choose management based on desire for accountability rather than career advancement, since the role requires completely new skills but remains reversible if it doesn't fit.
