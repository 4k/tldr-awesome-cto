## Key Insights

**3-Phase Release Framework (Alpha → Beta → GA)**
- Alpha: Test core assumption with 5-8 manual reviews, measure 15% download rate lift
- Beta: Scale to 20-30 reviews via automation, maintain performance with <3% user participation rate
- GA: Roll out to all users after proving concept and scaling mechanism

**Planning Phase Essentials**
- Draft internal press release before building (forces clarity on customer value)
- Pre-identify specific Alpha/Beta/GA customers with sales team
- Document both customer success metrics AND business metrics upfront
- Determine pricing strategy with revenue projections before development

**Cross-Functional Ownership Map**
- Product: Goals, metrics, customer research, UX breakdown
- Engineering: Architecture design, build/test cycles, demo environment
- Design: UX progression across phases, feedback incorporation
- Sales/CS: Customer identification, documentation, enablement content

**Post-Launch Process**
- Mandatory retrospective with all teams (Product, Engineering, Design, CS, Marketing, Sales)
- Document whether feature met both customer AND business goals
- Review lessons learned for future features

**Concrete Example Metrics**
- Target: 4.5+ star average from specific review counts per phase
- Success threshold: 15-20% lift in download rate KPI
- Beta participation benchmark: 3% of users write reviews

## Bottom Line

Use a structured 3-phase release process with pre-defined exit criteria, cross-functional ownership, and mandatory retrospectives to ensure features deliver measurable business value before full investment.
