## Key Insights
- **Three-pillar hiring framework**: Experience (stakeholder-centric partnership), Inclusivity (equitable processes), Predictability (right people, right roles, right time)
- **Distributed-first approach**: Built for fully remote, global talent acquisition from day one
- **Role-specific playbooks**: Separate training/playbooks for recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, and candidate experience specialists
- **Predictability focus**: Emphasizes forecast accuracy and data-driven decision making to enable business planning
- **Stakeholder experience prioritization**: Positions TA as strategic partner/advisor rather than order-taker
- **Inclusivity integration**: Designs equity into processes rather than treating as add-on
- **Comprehensive resource library**: Covers full hiring lifecycle from referrals to internal mobility
- **Transparency with boundaries**: Open handbook approach but strategic content restricted to internal teams

## Bottom Line
GitLab's TA framework centers on three pillars (experience, inclusivity, predictability) with distributed-first processes and role-specific playbooks to enable strategic hiring partnerships rather than transactional recruiting.
