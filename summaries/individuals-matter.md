## Key Insights

- **Heavy-tailed returns make individual differences critical**: When the right person can increase revenue by 0.7% on paternity leave alone, treating people as fungible becomes extremely costly
- **Team destruction is asymmetric**: Effective teams take time to build due to institutional knowledge and culture, but are easily destroyed by forced reassignments
- **Senior ICs predict reassignment failures accurately**: Management persists in thinking people can be redirected like SimCity workers despite consistent IC predictions of failure
- **Promotion incentives misalign with value creation**: Companies explicitly tie promotions to headcount managed rather than outcomes, encouraging empire-building over effectiveness
- **Bureaucratic processes create competitive disadvantage**: Companies with streamlined technical blog approval processes gain significant advantages over those with onerous review processes
- **$500B+ companies succeeded through aggressive non-bureaucratic moves**: Large winners made bets that wouldn't have been possible at bureaucracy-heavy competitors
- **Claimed wins often don't match actual results**: Internal analysis typically shows claimed revenue/growth wins are inflated compared to observable totals
- **Location-based pay adjustments backfire in remote work era**: Companies maintaining severe geographic pay differences lose talent to competitors with smaller adjustments
- **Winner-take-most markets punish lowest-common-denominator approaches**: Forcing uniform effectiveness ensures being an "also ran" in tech markets

## Bottom Line

In heavy-tailed outcome distributions, treating individuals as fungible and optimizing for bureaucratic legibility over individual effectiveness costs companies the majority of their potential returns.
