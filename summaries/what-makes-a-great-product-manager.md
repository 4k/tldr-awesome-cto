## Key Insights

**Core Foundation:**
- Start with customer problems, not features - write the reviews you aspire users to write
- Build for yourself when possible - creates natural empathy and intuitive product sense
- Set shared, aspirational + realistic + quantifiable goals that teams fundamentally believe in

**Strategic Skills:**
- Use competitor products daily and share market context via teardowns/presentations
- Understand technical feasibility to create tight feedback loops between ideas and implementation
- Embrace constraints as creativity drivers - "open ended" paralyzed teams

**Execution Excellence:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly - force tradeoffs at right time, cut features for simpler customer experience
- Think in complete experiences/scenarios, not features when building MVPs
- Lead with action - prototype over debate, ask forgiveness not permission
- Operate at right "zoom level" - detailed when progress needed, big picture when perspective required

**Decision Making:**
- Strong point of view + weakly held - provides direction while enabling pivots with evidence
- Data-driven but not data-dependent - understand diminishing returns on analysis
- Simplify complex problems into key questions - consider audience need, not what you can show

**People & Process:**
- Seek mentors, mentor others - learning accelerator and viewpoint reinforcement
- Create leveraged materials fit-for-purpose - don't over-engineer specs when email works
- Give specific, useful feedback focused on product not person
- Share work early and often when change cost is low

## Bottom Line
Great product managers combine customer obsession with execution pragmatism - they start with why, embrace constraints, prioritize ruthlessly, and maintain strong opinions loosely held.
