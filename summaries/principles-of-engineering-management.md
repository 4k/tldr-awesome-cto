## Key Insights

**Manager's Core Role:**
- Purpose: Clarify the "why" behind all work - motivation, scope, focus come from explaining why
- People: Ensure team has right skills, motivation, and understanding
- Process: Remove roadblocks, establish clear decision makers

**Management Self-Assessment Questions:**
- Do you find outcome achievement more motivating than playing a specific role?
- Can you be emotionally stable in challenging situations?
- Do you like talking to people extensively?

**Trust Building (Most Critical Asset):**
- Responsibility lies more with manager than direct report
- Reports naturally fear appearing as complainers/failures
- Must create environment where complete honesty has no retribution

**Feedback Framework:**
- Give task-specific feedback on deployments, meetings, code reviews
- Dedicate one 1-1 every two months specifically to growth/behavioral feedback
- Be as specific with praise as with criticism

**Proactive Management Rules:**
- All projects must be documented thoroughly
- No single gatekeeper of knowledge - spread across team/org
- Write down architectural decisions for future reference
- People leave due to: lack of growth, autonomy, or compensation

**Performance Issues Diagnosis:**
- Skills problem: Help learn or hire someone with skills
- Motivation problem: Unclear expectations, disinterest, or no rewards/penalties
- Solve through honest conversations only

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Replace your presence with documentation
- Create FAQ for repeated questions
- Makes team self-sufficient and unblocks people

## Bottom Line
Management success hinges on building trust through radical honesty, replacing yourself with documentation/processes, and proactively diagnosing whether performance issues stem from skills gaps or motivation problems.
