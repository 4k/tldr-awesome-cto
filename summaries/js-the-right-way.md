# JS: The Right Way

I cannot distill this article as requested because the content appears to be in Korean and primarily consists of sports betting analysis posts, gambling site promotions, and live sports streaming information rather than a technology article about JavaScript development.

The content includes:
- Sports betting predictions and analysis posts
- Casino and gambling site advertisements  
- Sports streaming service descriptions
- FAQ about watching sports broadcasts

This does not contain actionable technical insights, frameworks, or development guidance that would be relevant for a CTO. If you have a different article about "JS: The Right Way" or JavaScript best practices that you'd like me to distill, please provide that content instead.
