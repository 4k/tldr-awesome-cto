## Key Insights

**Role Definition**
- Focus on broadest definition: executive team member responsible for technical execution AND people management, regardless of CTO vs VPE title

**Core Priorities Framework**
- Business understanding: revenue sources, cash position, knowledge gaps between eng/business
- Culture assessment: true values, decision-making processes, who's valued/stagnating
- Peer relationships: what peers need from engineering before first conflict
- Execution effectiveness: idea-to-finished-work pipeline, emergency handling
- Technical quality: tool effectiveness, key behaviors, impossible projects
- Team inclusion/morale: success patterns, active inclusion efforts
- Sustainable pace: personal energy requirements, temporary vs permanent changes

**Critical First 90 Days Tasks**
- Get explicit written expectations from manager ("What will success look like?")
- Meet <30 people individually, use team meetings for larger orgs
- Shadow support tickets (customers = reality reservoir)
- Shadow customer/partner meetings and user testing
- Get data warehouse access and learn to query business analytics
- Document undocumented organizational processes
- Implement maximum 1-2 process changes
- Focus hiring on 3 or fewer key missing roles

**Execution Measurement**
- Use Accelerate metrics for internal velocity
- Track business impact metrics (revenue growth, experiments conducted)
- Add weekly operational review meeting
- Track hiring funnel metrics and pipeline

**Technology Approach**
- Build and deploy trivial change to understand dev workflow
- Join on-call rotation for operational context
- Attend incident reviews
- Record technology decision history and contexts
- Document implicit technology strategy

**Support System**
- Build external peer network before you need it
- Get executive coach (after establishing working context)
- Prioritize self-care during pattern reset period

## Bottom Line
Success requires understanding existing systems before changing them, focusing on 1-2 key improvements, and building both internal relationships and external support networks while measuring progress through specific business and team metrics.
