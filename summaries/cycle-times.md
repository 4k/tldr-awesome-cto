## Key Insights

- Cycle time = vertical leaps × people per level. Reduce vertical leaps first as it affects both variables
- Push decision-making down to senior ICs rather than managers (who have overhead dealing with people issues)
- Manager performance should measure "return on investment" not "absolute impact"
- Use Single Threaded Owners: 100% focused individuals with no other responsibilities for critical work
- Product managers/PMMs should represent multiple disciplines to reduce meeting size - documents with 50 co-authors = poor ownership and diffuse accountability
- Make decisions on demos/prototypes instead of docs/decks for more durable outcomes
- Most companies over-parallelize and under-prioritize - doing less improves cycle time
- Identify critical bottleneck people early, inform them of importance, sequence their involvement properly
- Late feedback that restarts progress is particularly costly - front-load critical stakeholder input
- Bad processes cost several multiples more than good processes benefit
- Teams shift from proactive to reactive when processes slow down, undermining conviction and cohesion
- Small teams for senior managers enable faster decision-making

## Bottom Line

Optimize cycle time by pushing decisions down to senior individual contributors, using single-threaded ownership, limiting meeting participants through representatives, and making decisions on prototypes rather than documents.
