## Key Insights

**Speed & Decision Making**
- Make provisional decisions instinctually, then gather only the specific information needed to disprove them
- Accept 10-20% error rate from subordinates to enable fast decision-making
- If you need multiple reasons to do something, don't do it—find one decisive reason
- Focus completely on Phase 1; nothing else matters if you don't nail the foundation

**People Management**
- Categorize engagement levels: Principal (driving), Board Member (regularly involved), Investor (reactive support), Friend (casual)
- Trade up on trust even if trading down on competency—choose fast-learning friends over more qualified strangers
- People with "alpha streaks" can manage status needs; "repressed alphas" crave status but deny it
- Even people who claim they don't need flattery often still require some deference

**Strategic Frameworks**
- Every weakness has a corresponding strength—managing weaknesses may eliminate related strengths
- Values that actually shape culture have both upside and downside (all-positive values are meaningless)
- Sketch three scenarios for any project: upside, regular, downside outcomes
- Group complex options into "light/medium/heavy" or "easy/medium/hard" buckets

**Relationship Building**
- Help first when approaching powerful people—offer unique information or perspectives they can't buy
- Make people genuine partners, not just helpers—shared credit drives harder work
- Identify misaligned incentives explicitly with partners to avoid future surprises
- Respect "shadow power"—assistants, advisors, spouses who influence decision-makers

**Execution Principles**
- People closest to execution should modify strategy based on ground-truth details
- Reason is steering wheel, emotion is gas pedal—integrate feelings into rational process
- Root for people's better angels despite their flaws—maintain complex portraits of individuals

## Bottom Line

Speed and simplicity in decision-making, combined with generous partnership and truth-telling, creates exponentially more impact than perfectionist planning or political maneuvering.
