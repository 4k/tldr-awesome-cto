## Key Insights

**Pipeline Management:**
- First 10 hires set bar for next 90 - they'll recruit the rest
- Hiring process: LinkedIn DM → 30min phone screen → 1hr coffee → 4hr onsite
- Ratchet up time/resources based on likelihood of fit + candidate enthusiasm
- Use paid 3-day to 2-week trials before full offers
- Hire for what you know best first (counter-intuitive but you can assess fit better)

**Sourcing Strategy:**
- Tell your story publicly/loudly - financing announcements are for recruiting, not customers
- Target 15-20 later-stage companies with similar business models
- Look for employees with 2+ years experience, 1-2 prior jobs, showing upward trajectory
- Mine personal network of 50-100 most talented contacts first

**Candidate Assessment:**
- Meet with A+ talent in the field to build "taste" for quality (even if you can't hire them)
- Avoid risk-averse candidates - Google APM post-2008 grads have never founded billion-dollar companies
- Look for generalists who can become experts in 90 days
- Test willingness to work outside defined scope - early roles are fluid
- Speed to offer is startup's biggest advantage over large companies

**Cultural Standards:**
- Zero defects = not taking enough risk on high-upside candidates
- Fire quickly to maintain A+ culture - makes next 5 hires exponentially easier
- Bear markets create talent monopolies (PayPal example)

**Closing Tactics:**
- Custom company swag (running jacket example)
- Help with relocation/flexible start dates
- Candidate delays almost always mean rejection

## Bottom Line
Hire for potential over experience, maintain ruthlessly high standards, and use speed/storytelling as competitive advantages against larger companies.
