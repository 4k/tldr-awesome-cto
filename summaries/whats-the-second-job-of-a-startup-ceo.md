## Key Insights

**Phase 2 CEO Transition (20-500 employees):**
- Must shift from "Doer-in-Chief" to "Company-Builder-in-Chief" 
- Delegate ALL Phase 1 activities (even product development) to focus on 3 CEO-only tasks
- Expect 25% of leadership hires to fail; fire underperforming executives quickly
- Success metric: 50% of time becomes unscheduled "think time"

**3 Non-Delegable CEO Tasks:**

1. **Leadership Team Building**
- Spend 50% of time hiring/managing senior executives
- Stage hires rather than hiring all at once
- Use executive search firms for first searches
- Manage executives to quarterly/annual outputs, not weekly tasks
- Patrick Collison's approach: Meet "best-in-world" candidates to calibrate judgment

2. **Mission-Strategy-Metrics Framework**
- Mission: Ambitious and permanent
- Strategy: Revisit twice yearly, write in long form
- Metrics: Focus on drivers of top-line results, not top-line itself
- Facebook example: "10 friends within 14 days" drove retention, not just "increase user growth"
- Over-communicate framework constantly

3. **Culture Nurturing**
- Culture = how people treat each other
- Don't write values solo; collaborate with early employees
- Values must reflect past authentic behavior, not aspirations
- Pixar example: Scrapped Toy Story 2 with 7 months left, closed studio 2 months for recovery

**Key Benchmarks:**
- Phase 2 starts: ~20-25 employees
- Phase 2 ends: ~400-500 employees  
- Executive failure rate: ~25%

## Bottom Line
Phase 2 CEOs must completely delegate operational work to focus exclusively on hiring executives, creating company-wide alignment through mission/strategy/metrics, and nurturing authentic culture based on past behaviors.
