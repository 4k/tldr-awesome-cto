## Key Insights

- Senior executives share 4 key traits: direct communication, fast pace, agenda control, and prepared question sequences
- Answer questions with numbers when possible ("7" vs. long explanations)
- Use simple hedging to provide threads for follow-up: "Yes, mostly" vs. disclaimers and caveats
- Bad answers waste time with filler, context, and excuses before getting to the point
- Best answer structure: Direct response + minimal qualifier that invites follow-up if needed
- Example framework:
  - Question: "Is project on time?"
  - Bad: Long explanation with risks/excuses
  - Good: "Yes, but server delivery holding us up"
  - Best: "Yes, mostly" (lets exec choose to dig deeper)
- Avoid presentations unless specifically requested - execs want to drive agenda
- Track question-answering patterns in meetings to identify how much time is wasted on non-answers
- Corporate meetings become "parallel independent conversations" when people don't answer questions and don't listen

## Bottom Line

Answer executive questions directly and concisely first, then provide minimal context only if it adds value or creates useful follow-up threads.
