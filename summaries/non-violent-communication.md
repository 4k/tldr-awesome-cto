## Key Insights

**Four-Step Nonviolent Communication Framework:**
1. **Observation**: State facts without judgment ("I see that you want this..." not "You don't respect your colleagues")
2. **Emotional Audit**: Use specific feeling words that don't blame others ("I feel tired" not "I feel unheard")
3. **Needs**: Identify what's missing ("I need space/appreciation/support")
4. **Requests**: Build flexibility into asks ("Would you be willing to..." not demands)

**A-E-I-O-U Conflict Resolution Model:**
- **Acknowledge**: State their positive intentions out loud
- **Express**: Use "I think/I feel" statements for your concerns
- **Identify**: Propose solutions with "I would like..." (not "I want...")
- **Outcome**: Explain benefits for them, offer recognition
- **Understanding**: Ask for feedback, allow face-saving exits

**Implementation Tactics:**
- Model behavior first—formal rollouts backfire
- Ask people to repeat back instructions to check understanding
- Use moderators for heated conflicts
- Ask resisters: "What do you ultimately want to achieve?"
- Take breaks/walks to reset escalated conversations
- Reference shared history/early days to realign teams

**Key Metrics:**
- Teams working 12-14 hour days need open questions, not closed yes/no demands
- Early conflicts affect entire teams in startups due to small size
- Higher interpersonal skills correlate with increased productivity and satisfaction

## Bottom Line
Replace fear-based closed questions with open ones using structured frameworks to transform team productivity and prevent small conflicts from destroying startups.
