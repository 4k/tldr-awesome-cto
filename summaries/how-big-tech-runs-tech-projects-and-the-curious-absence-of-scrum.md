# How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum

## Key Insights

**Big Tech Project Management Patterns:**
- Engineers lead 90%+ of projects (no dedicated team-level PMs)
- Teams choose their own methodology - RFC planning + iterative building/shipping
- Technical Program Manager ratio: ~1:50 engineers (only for multi-team projects)
- First-class dev tooling enables daily shipping vs quarterly releases

**Survey Findings (100+ companies):**
- Teams with dedicated PMs show lower satisfaction at tech companies
- Team autonomy correlates with high satisfaction (4-5/5 ratings)
- JIRA has Net Promoter Score of -83 at high-growth tech companies
- Engineers excluded from estimation = top demotivator and retention risk

**Scrum Works When:**
- "Kitchen sink teams" need stakeholder management structure
- New teams in forming/storming phases need defined processes
- Shipping cadence <monthly needs acceleration to 2-4 week cycles
- Organizations require unified progress reporting

**What Kills Project Success:**
- Requirements changing despite dedicated PMs
- No autonomy to modify failing processes
- Engineers not involved in commitments they're held to
- Optimizing for reporting over execution

**Organizational Structure Enablers:**
- Internal transparency (code, data, metrics access)
- Engineer-to-business exposure vs triangular communication
- Cross-functional teams of 5-15 people with clear ownership
- Platform teams handle 30-40% of engineering (reduce dev friction)

**Decision Speed Formula:**
- Fewer people in decision chain = faster execution
- Engineer-to-engineer communication > PM intermediaries
- Rotating project lead roles among engineers builds leadership

## Bottom Line
High-performing tech companies optimize for team autonomy and minimal process overhead rather than standardized methodologies, but this only works with competent people, strong tooling, and organizational trust.
