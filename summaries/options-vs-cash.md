## Key Insights

**Tax Structure**
- ISOs have preferential tax treatment but most nonstatutory options create taxable income at exercise (fair market value minus strike price)
- Strike price must equal fair market value for ISOs; private companies get infrequent third-party valuations creating potential discounts

**Financial Reality Check**
- Working at big tech + investing $25k/year in startups beats joining startups financially
- At $10M seed valuations: $100k investment = 1% equity vs. 4-year vesting + worse equity class as employee
- Median employee at 99%-ile exits ($1B+) underperforms standard Facebook/Google/Amazon career trajectory
- Netflix's all-cash model shows better retention than equity-heavy startups

**Options as Control Mechanism**
- Lock-in effect keeps employees through illiquid vesting schedules
- Companies retain more control giving options to employees vs. equity to VCs (employee equity spread across many people)
- Poor retention mechanism in practice - cash-paying companies have lower attrition

**Performance Misalignment**
- Options decouple job performance from compensation
- Company picking matters infinitely more than individual performance
- Microsoft created ~10,000 millionaires; most had no instrumental role in success
- Post-IPO joiners at major tech companies often outperform pre-IPO startup employees

**Valuation Arbitrage**
- Third-party valuations updated infrequently and incentivized to stay low (paid by startups)
- Creates gaps between "real" and legal valuations, but offers adjust accordingly

## Bottom Line

Startup options primarily benefit founders and investors through employee lock-in and control retention, while employees would generally earn more working at big tech companies and investing surplus cash directly in startups.
