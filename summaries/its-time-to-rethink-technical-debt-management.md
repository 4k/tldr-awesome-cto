I notice you've provided what appears to be marketing copy for a test impact analytics tool rather than a full article about technical debt management. This looks like product promotional material with bullet points about features and capabilities.

Could you please share the actual article content about "It's Time to Rethink Technical Debt Management"? I need the full article text to provide the distilled insights you're looking for, not just the product description/advertisement that appears to be embedded within it.
