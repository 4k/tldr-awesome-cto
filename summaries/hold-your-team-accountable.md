## Key Insights

**Accountability Definition:**
- To be accountable = provide an account of what's happening
- To hold accountable = ask questions about what's happening
- Core framework: "What happened?" and "This is what happened"

**The Accountability Dial (5 levels):**
1. The Mention: "Hey I noticed [behavior]... is everything okay?"
2. The Invitation: "I've mentioned [behaviors] a few times... what's the pattern?"
3. The Conversation: "[Behaviors] are impacting the team... let's discuss how to resolve"
4. The Boundary: "If [behaviors] don't change, we may have to consider [consequences]"
5. The Limit: "This is your final warning..."

**Critical Management Techniques:**
- Ask open questions vs. requests: "What will you do to make sure you arrive on time?" vs. "Please try to arrive on time"
- Distinguish excuses from reasons: Excuses assume no responsibility, reasons acknowledge personal role
- Don't solve problems immediately - ask "What will you do about it?" instead
- CEO suggestions often sound like decisions to teams - be careful with "suggestions"

**Consequence Types:**
- Protective consequences: Address actual business/team needs (removing remote work flexibility for chronic lateness)
- Punitive consequences: Designed to punish (excluding from company trip)
- Spectrum includes: reduced flexibility, role changes, formal warnings, extra training, termination

## Bottom Line
Effective accountability requires asking probing questions and resisting the urge to solve problems for your team, using escalating feedback levels while distinguishing between protective vs. punitive consequences.
