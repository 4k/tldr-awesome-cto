## Key Insights
- Knowledge-sharing architects focus on disseminating technical knowledge rather than direct coding, addressing the bottleneck of architectural expertise concentration
- Two main approaches: "Broadcasting" (one-to-many presentations, documentation) and "Mentoring" (one-on-one guidance with individual developers)
- Broadcasting scales better but lacks personalization; mentoring provides deeper impact but doesn't scale
- Hybrid model recommended: Use broadcasting for foundational concepts, mentoring for complex problem-solving
- Metrics to track: number of developers trained, architectural decision quality improvements, reduced escalation to senior architects
- Common failure modes: architects who can't communicate effectively, over-reliance on documentation without interactive elements
- Implementation pattern: Start with 20% time allocation to knowledge sharing, measure impact, then adjust
- Knowledge-sharing architects should rotate between teams to prevent knowledge silos
- Documentation should be living/interactive rather than static - wikis, decision trees, and recorded decision rationales work better than lengthy documents

## Bottom Line
Replace coding architects with knowledge-sharing architects who multiply impact through teaching and mentoring, using a hybrid broadcast/mentoring model to scale architectural expertise across teams.
