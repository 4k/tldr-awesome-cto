## Key Insights

- **Mindset shift**: When hiring senior engineers, you're selling, not buying - candidates choose you, not vice versa
- **Job posting optimization**: Most postings are 50%+ about what employer needs vs what they offer; should be reverse-optimized like candidate resumes
- **Information accessibility**: Make critical company info (management style, team size, tech stack, work environment, dress code) findable within one click of job posting
- **Interview process fixes**: 
  - Be on time and prepared
  - Read resume beforehand
  - Have structured approach
  - Answer candidate questions, don't just interrogate
  - Make quick decisions without being pushy
- **Technical assessments**: Do them last after making candidate want the job; let candidates choose between take-home vs on-site; make it collaborative, not a test
- **Skills evaluation**: Experienced engineers can often assess technical ability through conversation about projects and interests rather than formal coding tests
- **Company weakness strategy**: Know and openly communicate your limitations (no remote work, rigid hours) to avoid bad-fit hires
- **Process speed**: Respond quickly to applications; weeks of silence kills candidate interest

## Bottom Line
Successful engineering hiring requires flipping from a buyer mentality to a seller mentality - optimize every touchpoint to sell your opportunity to candidates who have multiple options.
