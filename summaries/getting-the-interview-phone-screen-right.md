## Key Insights

**Phone Screen Structure:**
- Interviewer should drive conversation, not candidate - avoid letting them ramble about past work
- Push candidates out of comfort zone with unfamiliar problems to test adaptability
- Look for "total vacuum" in knowledge areas, not minor struggles or rustiness
- One failed phone screen saves 8+ man-hours wasted on unqualified face-to-face interviews

**Five Essential Areas to Test:**

**Coding:** Simple syntax verification
- Examples: reverse string, Nth Fibonacci, print odd numbers 1-99, find largest int in array
- 25-35% of candidates fail basic problems like FizzBuzz

**OO Design:** Basic principles understanding
- Examples: design deck of cards, model animal kingdom, represent filesystem
- Test familiarity with OO concepts, not comprehensive design

**Scripting/Regex:** Tool selection over reinvention
- Standard test: Find phone numbers in 50,000 HTML files in 2 days
- 25-35% cannot solve even with hints - indicates whether developer will waste days on automatable tasks

**Data Structures:** Core CS fundamentals
- Must know arrays, vectors, linked lists, hashtables, trees, graphs
- Understand Big-O complexity: constant, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, exponential, factorial

**Bits/Bytes:** Low-level programming basics
- Test high-order bit detection, bit counting, palindrome bit patterns
- Should know 2^16, AND/OR/XOR operations, signed vs unsigned

**Red Flags:**
- One-trick ponies who only know single language/environment
- Candidates who can't explain why "Oct 31 = Dec 25" programmer joke is funny

## Bottom Line
A structured phone screen testing these five technical fundamentals eliminates most unqualified candidates before expensive on-site interviews, with each prevented interview saving 8+ man-hours.
