## Key Insights

**Preparation Framework:**
- Talk prep is primarily about talking out loud, not writing slides - practice speaking while standing/pacing in private space
- Do exactly one run-through per day to allow partial forgetting between sessions, preventing robotic delivery
- Start with zero plan - improvise on topic for 15 minutes to 2 hours, capturing interesting moments as simple note slides
- Repeat 3+ times, rearranging/adding/deleting slides based on what feels natural when spoken

**ROI Math:**
- 500-person audience × 30-minute talk = 250 person-hours consumed
- Popular talk videos get 50,000+ views = 25,000 person-hours optimized
- 20 hours prep time = 1,250:1 ratio of viewer time to preparation time

**Structure Development:**
- After ~4 practice runs, group slides into 4-8 sections with short names
- Use stark visual contrast (white-on-black section slides, black-on-white content slides)
- Build complex slides (code, tables) piece-by-piece to control audience attention
- Cut sections when practice runs become annoying - this indicates talk is ready for reduction

**Technical Specs:**
- Font size: Capital X height should be ≥0.03× slide height for back-row visibility
- Safety margins: 0.05× screen width/height on all sides to avoid projection issues
- Target length: 25 minutes is sweet spot; most 50-minute talks are bloated 25-minute talks

**Final Optimization:**
- When talk feels too long, hide least-interesting sections and test flow
- Practice section transitions 10× when cutting content
- Stop major changes when you no longer feel compelled to edit
- Never practice more than once on talk day to avoid voice fatigue

## Bottom Line
Build talks through daily improvisation sessions rather than slide writing, using spoken repetition and strategic forgetting to develop authentic, well-structured presentations that optimize thousands of person-hours of audience time.
