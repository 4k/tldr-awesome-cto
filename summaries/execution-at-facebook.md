## Key Insights

**PM Role Definition:**
- PMs responsible for 2 outcomes: strategy ("what game we're playing") and execution ("how we play it")
- Strategy = finding investment areas + creating compelling vision aligned with users/business
- Execution = prioritization/roadmapping + process management (brief → launch)
- PMs 100% accountable for team results regardless of who does the work

**Meta-Execution Framework:**
- Meta-execution = executing through others to scale impact
- Stack rank execution tasks by PM uniqueness: strategy/vision (always PM) → communication/project mgmt (can delegate)
- Senior PMs focus on problems only they can solve, delegate execution to capable team leaders
- Enables PM capacity for long-term strategy while maintaining accountability

**Empowered vs Non-Empowered Teams:**
- Non-empowered: exist "to serve the business" (assigned projects)
- Empowered: exist "to serve customers in ways that meet business needs" (choose what to build)
- Empowered teams evaluated on outcomes, not inputs
- Engineers want PMs finding high-impact projects rather than managing task execution

**Engineer-PM Collaboration Patterns:**
- Engineers drive: solution ownership, progress tracking, feature-level meetings/docs, project management execution
- PMs drive: roadmap process, team-level structure/communication, milestone frameworks
- Engineers gain product decision involvement through execution ownership
- Team adjusts roles dynamically based on highest impact allocation

**Success Metrics:**
- Nobody cares about Gantt charts, only on-time delivery
- Nobody cares about meeting agendas, only project impact
- Focus on outputs (results) not inputs (tasks)

## Bottom Line
Facebook PMs succeed by owning outcomes while delegating execution to engineers who want product ownership, creating empowered teams that optimize for impact over role boundaries.
