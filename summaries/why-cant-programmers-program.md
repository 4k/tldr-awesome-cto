## Key Insights
- 199 out of 200 programming job applicants cannot write any code whatsoever
- Majority of CS graduates fail "FizzBuzz" test: write program printing 1-100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", both with "FizzBuzz"
- Good programmers solve FizzBuzz in under 2 minutes; self-proclaimed senior developers take 10-15+ minutes
- Candidates with master's/PhDs fail basic tasks: "write loop counting 1-10" or "what's the number after F in hex?"
- Code samples required before phone interviews prevent wasting time on non-programmers
- On-site coding exercises (1-hour small application build) effectively screen candidates
- Pre-screening strategy allows interviews to focus on actual software engineering vs puzzle questions

## Bottom Line
The programming job market has a shocking signal-to-noise problem where 99.5% of applicants literally cannot code, requiring mandatory pre-screening with trivial programming tests before any interview time investment.
