## Key Insights

**Scaling Metrics (2021 actual vs planned):**
- Engineering team: 17 (+112% vs planned ~18)
- Company size: 40 (+136% vs planned ~45)
- Geographic distribution doubled: 28 cities, 10 countries, 7 time zones

**Critical Delegation Framework:**
- Ask constantly: "What should I be doing now not to have to work again?"
- Hiring Executive Assistant was transformational for calendar/email control
- Founder bottleneck after 4 years = major red flag

**Hiring Realities:**
- VPE search: 6 months, 40+ candidates, extremely draining but non-delegable
- SRE/Engineering Manager roles take significantly longer than expected
- Market timing underestimation caused organizational strain
- MOC (mission-outcomes-competencies) document essential for executive alignment

**Executive Search Lessons:**
- Distinguish between "war-time" VPEs (rebuild dysfunctional teams) vs growth VPEs (scale existing culture)
- Executive search firms worth the cost for candidate exposure
- Need someone to complement, not replace, technical founder strengths

**Operational Infrastructure:**
- API serving 600M+ requests/day
- SOC 2 compliance required for enterprise deals
- Reliability squad creation was overdue

**Personal Sustainability:**
- Geographic relocation dramatically improved mental health and team performance
- Burnout prevention: watch for signs, establish boundaries, take real vacations
- Working longer hours as coping mechanism is dangerous

**2022 Focus Areas:**
- Double team again to ~34 engineers
- Deterministic onboarding for 100+ engineer scale
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure investment

## Bottom Line
Scaling from 8 to 17 engineers requires ruthless delegation and executive hiring, with founder burnout being the biggest risk to continued growth.
