## Key Insights

**The Three Golden Rules:**

**Rule #1: Only CTOs can hire developers**
- Non-technical founders lack the expertise to evaluate technical talent or organize dev teams
- If you can assess technical skills, you ARE the CTO

**Rule #2: Don't sell the job, sell the adventure**
- CTOs join for disruption and challenge, not coding tasks
- Pitch creative control and decision-making authority, not feature lists
- Address objections upfront (no salary → show investor connections for future funding)
- Stay vague on technical specs - let candidates propose their approach

**Rule #3: Hire 3 years ago, not today**
- Founding teams need time to build working relationships before crises hit
- If hiring now is unavoidable, focus on cultural fit over pure technical skills

**Sourcing strategies:**
- **Startup Weekend**: Go to meet developers, not start companies
- **Geographic diversity**: Travel to events in other cities/countries to avoid local talent competition  
- **Strategic poaching**: Target developers at struggling startups in your space - they have domain knowledge and may be ready to jump

**Effective CTO pitch example breakdown:**
- Lead with personality/culture fit ("RUDE CTO")
- Emphasize disruption opportunity 
- Show flexibility on technical choices
- Address compensation honestly with upside potential
- Require writing skills for communication

## Bottom Line

Stop posting generic developer job descriptions and instead sell the founding opportunity, strategic influence, and adventure to someone who can actually build your technical team.
