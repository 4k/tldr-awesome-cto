## Key Insights

**High Performer Characteristics:**
- Work within their Zone of Genius (ZoG) majority of time; proactively outsource/delegate weaknesses
- Use "Issue + Proposed Solution" framework when presenting problems

2. **Create Trust:** Achieve through clarity + care + transparency + consistency
3. **Ongoing Development:** Provide continuous challenge beyond 90-day onboarding

**Trust Building Tactics:**
- Day 1: Establish working agreements, define excellence standards, confirm 30-60-90 expectations
- Monthly: Run "Magic Questions" with direct reports
- Quarterly: Discuss progress against direct report's 5-year professional dream
- Monthly minimum: Give clear, unbiased absolute feedback

**Management Delegation:**

- Never outsource: direct feedback delivery and remembering personal info of direct reports

**Performance Standards:**
- High performers expect other high performers (positive-sum mindset)
- Clear talent density requirements for graceful underperformer exits
- Feedback is prerequisite to high performance; trust is prerequisite to feedback
