## Key Insights

**Only 3 strategies drive early B2B customer acquisition (vs 7 for consumer):**
- Personal network (friends, former colleagues, investors, incubator peers)
- Going where customers are (communities, forums, events, door-to-door)
- Press coverage

**Personal network dominance:**
- Almost every B2B company uses BOTH network + customer hunting simultaneously
- Network especially critical for "sell-to" vs bottom-up products (trust factor)
- YC "Collison installation": Don't just ask for beta trial - grab their laptop and set it up immediately

**Specific sourcing examples:**
- Stripe: YC peers became first users, spread through word-of-mouth
- Figma: Used Twitter data to identify influential designers, cold emailed filtered list
- Square: Walked door-to-door to local merchants they could visit multiple times weekly
- New Relic: Targeted Ruby on Rails community (small but growing, high adoption rate)
- Salesforce: First customer was founder's portfolio company (favor + genuine need)

**Network building tactics:**
- Bring on connector investors
- Join incubators like YC for peer network
- Target 15-18 new prospects monthly via LinkedIn alumni networks
- Ask existing customers to evangelize through simple referral programs

**Press strategy nuances:**
- Launch coverage: Dropbox's Hacker News video, Twilio's TechCrunch rickroll
- Canva built 50k waitlist pre-launch through "stealth startup" press
- Press rarely primary acquisition channel - usually amplifies other efforts

## Bottom Line
B2B customer acquisition boils down to leveraging personal networks first, then systematically hunting prospects in their natural habitats, with press as amplification rather than primary driver.
