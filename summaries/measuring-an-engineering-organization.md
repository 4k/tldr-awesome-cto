## Key Insights

**Four Measurement Categories for Self:**
- **Plan**: Track shipped projects by team + business impact to support project selection/prioritization
- **Operate**: Monitor incidents (with reviews), downtime minutes, API latency, engineering cost per business metric, app store ratings, onboarding conversion
- **Optimize**: Use SPACE framework or developer productivity surveys to understand system feedback loops
- **Inspire**: Maintain list of technical investments that transformed "impossible" into "obvious" for annual planning cycles

**Four Stakeholder Categories:**
- **CEO/Board**: Reuse planning/operational metrics; avoid optimization metrics (efficiency ≠ impact to non-engineers)
- **Finance**: Track headcount vs budget, vendor costs vs budget, capitalization justification; document engineering allocation across business units
- **Strategic Peers** (Product/Design/Sales): Use same planning metrics for alignment
- **Tactical Peers** (Customer Success/Legal): Agree on concrete numbers they can be accountable for

**Sequencing Rules:**
- Only measure difficult things if you'll actually use the data for decisions
- Measure easy things to build stakeholder trust, even if imperfect
- Take on only one new measurement at a time

**Key Anti-patterns:**
- Using measurement to solve trust issues (address root frustration instead)
- Perfectionism preventing any measurement
- Using optimization metrics to judge individual/team performance
- Measuring individuals instead of teams

**Data Validation Process:**
- Review weekly with month/quarter/year trends
- Maintain hypothesis for data changes; investigate violations
- Segment data to capture distinct experiences (geography, tech stack)
- Compare objective metrics with subjective team experience

## Bottom Line
Start measuring for your own operational needs first, then layer on stakeholder requirements one at a time, focusing on building trust through consistent reporting rather than perfect metrics.
