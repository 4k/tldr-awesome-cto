## Key Insights

- **9 Mandate Levels Framework**: Work ranges from very specific (A) to very general (I), defining spheres of authority and autonomy
- **Team comparisons reveal structure**: Team operating at metric-defined bets vs. customer segment + activity shows different empowerment levels
- **Role boundaries matter**: Rigid boundaries (developers A-C, product owner D) vs. overlapping mandates in product-led companies
- **"Trio" model**: Designer, lead developer, product manager share higher mandates while other developers max at Level C (risk: boredom)
- **Work is fractal**: Activity happens at all levels simultaneously; question is who operates where
- **Mandate ownership ≠ isolation**: Others will still be interested in your work and resulting lower-level tasks
- **Architecture constrains empowerment**: Current org structure and systems may limit mandate level options regardless of intent
- **Experience gates capability**: New developers may find Level D daunting; veterans may leave if capped below Level X
- **OKR trap**: Can't fake mandate levels by asking teams to create OKRs they can't actually control or influence
- **Dynamic mandates**: Levels can shift during initiatives - often starting high then trending lower as learning occurs
- **Anti-pattern**: "Annual planning" requests often cause premature convergence and reduce everyone's mandate levels

## Bottom Line
Replace vague "empowerment" talk with specific mandate level discussions to clarify who has authority to make what types of decisions across the work spectrum.
