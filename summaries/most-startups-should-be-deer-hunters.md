## Key Insights

**Animal Customer Segmentation Framework:**
- **Elephants (Enterprise)**: High-value deals ($500k-$1M+) but consume all development resources through custom features, steep SLAs, and service demands. Can make startups lose strategic focus
- **Rabbits (SMB/Freemium)**: $5-40/month customers. High volume needed but hard to catch, low revenue per customer makes economics difficult unless building massive scale (Twitter/Facebook model)  
- **Deer (Mid-market)**: Right-sized customers who pay fair prices, make reasonable demands, don't control your roadmap, and allow strategic focus

**Specific Problems with Elephants:**
- Force you to build "missing" features that steer you off MVP
- Require custom development that other customers won't use
- Demand high service levels that consume entire teams
- Create single points of failure - losing one customer can devastate the business
- Make simultaneous SMB serving nearly impossible due to different needs/channels

**Rabbit Economics Don't Work Unless:**
- Building massive transaction volume business (social networks, gaming)
- Have proven partner distribution channels
- Can achieve true self-service with minimal support costs

**Deer Hunting Benefits:**
- Customers can't make huge demands on development resources
- Won't negotiate standard terms extensively  
- Losing one customer isn't devastating
- Allows maintaining strategic focus without compromise
- Easier to serve and scale

**Real Example:** Author's first company landed $500k-$1M European enterprise deals but spent all resources on custom features and high-touch service instead of core product development.

## Bottom Line
Most startups should target mid-market "deer" customers who pay fair prices but can't force you to abandon your product strategy through excessive customization demands.
