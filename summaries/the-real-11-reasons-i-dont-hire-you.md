## Key Insights
- **Scarcity constraints**: Early-stage startups have few precious slots tied to specific company goals, unlike big tech "hire if qualified" approach
- **Team composition over individual merit**: Spend equal time analyzing team gaps (mentoring, technical specialties, future managers) as evaluating candidates
- **Diversity of experience matters more than demographics**: Avoid hiring all ex-FAANG/ex-MIT engineers who share same blind spots
- **Level balancing**: Teams need mix of seniority levels - too many senior engineers creates dysfunction, boredom, and stunted growth
- **Work availability matching**: Must have appropriate level of work - junior devs failed when only complex tasks available
- **Communication as core technical skill**: Technical interview requires explaining code changes to peers - "if you can explain what you did and why, you can do the work"
- **Startup reality check**: Red flag when candidates want startup experience but also demand predictability, strict hours, no on-call, high stability
- **Mission alignment litmus test**: "Because it was founded by women" as sole reason shows lack of genuine interest in problem/product
- **Success prediction**: Key question is "can we make this person successful in this role at this time?" considering skills, location, remote experience
- **Mutual fit assessment**: Only hire people whose hearts are in it and who see work as extension of themselves

## Bottom Line
Hiring decisions at constrained startups are primarily about team composition and mutual fit rather than individual capability assessments.
