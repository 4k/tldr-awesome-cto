## Key Insights

- At $1.5M ARR (Initial Traction), you're ready for VPs across all functions, not just sales
- VP of Product becomes critical when scaling from 100 to 1,000+ customers and simple to complex feature sets - handles enterprise customer synthesis that founders can't manage at scale
- VP of Marketing must own lead/opportunity commits and revenue numbers - junior roles only provide "help," VPs drive $1.5M to $10M growth acceleration
- VP of Customer Success should carry expansion revenue targets (10-20% YoY growth from installed base) and aggressively attack churn/almost-churn with systematic processes
- VP of Engineering frees CTO from "been done before" work (scaling, security, devops, hiring) to focus on novel innovation only they can do
- Common founder mistake: hiring directors instead of VPs to save money - 95% of the time only VPs can truly own outcomes and numbers
- VP of Business Development needed because CEOs lack 40+ hours/week for partner relationship management across multiple stakeholders
- Cash constraints are valid but separate from readiness - most founders think they're "not ready" when they actually just haven't worked with great VPs
- Great VPs are accretive and self-funding through productivity gains and faster growth
- Key milestone: transition from "Repeatable" to "Repeating" revenue signals VP readiness across all functions

## Bottom Line
Once you hit $1.5M ARR, you need great VPs in every function because they own outcomes and accelerate growth in ways junior hires cannot, and resistance usually means you've never worked with a truly great VP before.
