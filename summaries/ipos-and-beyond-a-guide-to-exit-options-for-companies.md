## Key Insights

**Exit Option Economics:**
- IPOs see average 18% price increase from initial range to final pricing since 2019; 33% first-day pop for enterprise tech since 2020
- SPACs cost 15-20% in sponsor fees + warrants + higher transaction costs; PIPE discount now 25-30% (up from 15-20%)
- Direct Listings eliminate IPO discount but only 10 deals completed (1% of market)
- M&A generally produces lower valuations than IPOs in hot markets due to buyer expertise and forecast haircuts

**Market Dynamics:**
- 700+ unicorns worth ~$2.2T globally creating massive IPO backlog
- Only ~20% of IPO allocation goes to "flippers," creating supply scarcity driving pops
- Global M&A at $4T through Aug 2021 (record high); tech sector $1.1T (up 182%)
- Secondary market growing: Carta facilitated $4.7B across 77 programs in 9 months 2021 vs $2.2B in full year 2020

**Structural Changes:**
- SPAC approval timeline increased from 3.5 to 5.5 months due to SEC scrutiny
- NYSE/Nasdaq approved primary capital raising for Direct Listings
- Companies typically limit employee secondary sales to ~10% of vested shares
- Secondary trading prices now influence Direct Listing reference prices

**Decision Framework:**
- IPOs/DLs best for strong companies in hot markets seeking highest valuations
- SPACs for companies with less-proven models needing earlier public access
- M&A for guaranteed full exit but likely lower valuations
- Secondary sales for employee retention without company exit

## Bottom Line
Exit choice depends on company maturity and market conditions, with IPOs offering highest valuations in hot markets but SPACs providing earlier access for less-proven companies at significantly higher cost.
