## Key Insights

**Framework for Successful On-Call Rotations:**

- **Tip #1**: Every rotation needs an owner (usually manager) who knows about all wake-ups the next day and uses this data to prevent repeat issues
- **Tip #2**: Code is liability - best engineers work hardest to NOT write more code; use on-call time to fix within existing codebase
- **Tip #3**: Services need owners, not operators - devs on-call creates ownership vs "throwing over the wall"
- **Tip #4**: Use wake-up time strategically: answer support tickets, fix staging/CI, handle unreliable tests, security bounties
- **Tip #5**: Signal value through manager actions - remove yourself from rotation to provide backup, tell people to stay home after all-night incidents

**Operational Rules:**
- Use your SLA downtime budget: "If you haven't used your downtime, you aren't taking enough risks"
- Only page when "the world is on fire" - most issues don't require 3am wake-ups
- Never page new parents - "You should not have more than one thing waking you up"
- Team burnout happens faster than customer burnout

**Cultural Shifts:**
- Reframe as honor/privilege, not punishment
- Manager stays off rotation to provide support coverage
- Focus on sustainability through distributed knowledge
- Primary purpose: stop writing shit software and align infrastructure with DevOps

## Bottom Line

On-call rotations drive code quality and team ownership when structured with dedicated rotation owners, strategic use of wake-up time for maintenance tasks, and managers who model compassionate support rather than participate in rotations themselves.
