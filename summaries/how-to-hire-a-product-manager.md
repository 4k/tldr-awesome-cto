## Key Insights

**Prioritize raw intelligence over experience**
- Smart, inexperienced PM beats average intellect with years of experience
- Test reaction to analytical challenges - best candidates get excited, counter with own questions
- Ask questions until you're sure candidate is smarter than you

**Technical background critical but with caveats**
- Technical PMs can relate to engineers and grasp product complexities
- Major pitfall: Former engineers who still try to control technical decisions crash spectacularly
- Prefer technical people who've already transitioned to PM role at previous job

**Product instincts are innate, not learnable**
- Look for candidates who independently echo your product concerns
- They should teach you something new about your product during interview
- Should turn you on to something innovative you hadn't heard of
- Can be tuned but cannot be learned from scratch

**Leadership without authority**
- PMs lead by influence, not direct reports
- Most effective evaluation: reference checks with peers and individual contributors
- Must wear multiple hats - advocate for whoever isn't in the room (customer, engineering, sales, executives)

**Interview process structure**
- Include representatives from engineering, design, marketing minimum
- Get specific functional feedback: "see how well they'd understand channel development issues"
- Don't require everyone's thumbs-up, but get diverse perspectives

**Shipping experience trumps theory**
- Unless very junior role, hire PMs who've shipped start-to-finish
- Past performance indicates future success
- Check references with manager, engineering counterparts, sales/marketing partners

## Bottom Line
Hire the smartest person with technical background, innate product instincts, and proven shipping experience - everything else can be developed.
