## Key Insights

**Timing**: Only conduct serious reverse interviews after you have the job offer negotiated - this is when you have power to ask uncomfortable questions without jeopardizing the opportunity

**Company Evaluation Bullseye Framework**: 
- Center: Non-negotiables (rigid, 100% requirements)
- Middle: Personal PMF (3-5 flexible pillars, company must score high on 3-4)
- Outer: Structured question themes (Culture, Strategy, Role, Goals, Communication)

**Critical Reverse Interview Questions**:
- Culture: "What characteristics define people who join but don't last long here?"
- Strategy: "What do I have to believe for you to reach $1B revenue?" 
- Role: "Why would I fail in this role?"
- Expectations: "What were you surprised by when you onboarded?"

**Back-channel Reference Red Flag**: If potential manager won't provide contacts of 3 people they managed directly, consider bowing out immediately

**Question Technique**: Don't accept general answers - dig deeper with "how" and demand specific examples, not hypotheticals

**Self-Discovery Process**: Use compounding questions + "Five Whys" technique:
- When was I happiest/miserable in career?
- What do I consider my best work?
- What makes me feel fulfilled?

**Back-channel Questions for Former Direct Reports**:
- Feedback style during success vs mistakes
- Goal-setting approach  
- What it took to get promoted under them

**Documentation**: Create table with themes as rows, questions and "who to ask" as columns - ask same question to multiple people to check consistency

## Bottom Line

Reverse interviewing after getting an offer and conducting thorough back-channel references are the highest-leverage activities for avoiding bad career moves and information asymmetry in hiring.
