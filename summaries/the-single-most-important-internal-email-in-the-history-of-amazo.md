## Key Insights

**Bezos's API Mandate (2002)**
- All teams must expose data/functionality through service interfaces only
- No direct team communication except via network service calls
- All interfaces must be designed to be externally accessible from day one
- Violation = termination
- This mandate enabled AWS by forcing internal dogfooding and platform thinking

**Organization Structure Types**
- **Functional** (Apple): Organized by expertise, creates consistency but bureaucracy/slowness
- **Divisional** (Amazon): Organized by product, enables speed/innovation but creates inconsistency
- **Hybrid** (Netflix): "Highly aligned, loosely coupled" - debate strategy together, execute independently

**Communication Framework Spectrum**
- **Co-located Synchronous** (Apple): Traditional, highly coordinated but rigid, scales poorly
- **Co-located Asynchronous** (Amazon): Same location, API-like team interactions, limited meetings
- **Distributed Asynchronous**: No HQ, maximum autonomy, physical constraints become advantages
- **Distributed Synchronous** (InVision): No HQ but 4+ hour daily overlap in single timezone
- **Remote Asynchronous** (Basecamp): HQ exists but team distributed globally

**Key Principle**
- Asynchronous communication provides maximum optionality - everything that works async can work sync, but not vice versa
- Async requires more upfront investment in processes/documentation but scales logarithmically vs linear scaling of sync
- Conway's Law in action: communication structure directly shapes product architecture

## Bottom Line
Amazon's internal API mandate proves that changing communication infrastructure before organizational structure is the most powerful lever for architectural transformation.
