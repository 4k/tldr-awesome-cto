## Key Insights

**Manager Value Proposition:**
- Good managers can increase productivity 5-10x by "running interference" - handling external interactions so workers can focus
- Management most useful in: large/high-turnover environments, jobs with heavy incoming information, work with significant obstructions
- Management may interfere with: creative work, fundamental engineering/research

**Communication Frameworks:**
- Treat manager requirements like any other source - assume they know more about business context than you do
- For design work complaints: Document progress through whiteboards, papers summarizing issues - helps clarify your thinking and shows visible progress
- When stuck: Use "lost keys" analogy - explain why you can't just keep searching the same places repeatedly

**Workplace Navigation:**
- Formal dress/titles are part of manager's job to interact with corporate hierarchy, not personal preference
- When identifying coworker problems: Take manager aside with details, don't nag, focus on helping solve rather than complaining
- For boring work requests: Explain task necessity, get "general troubleshooting" added to job description, document usefulness with testimonials

**Salary/Career Issues:**
- If you earn as much as manager: Request extended benefits or freelance consulting permission as alternatives
- When offered management roles: Explain you enjoy current work for its own merits, not as advancement stepping stone

**Estimation Pressure:**
- Managers need predictable schedules for business planning/payroll
- Always provide estimates even when uncertain - warn about inaccuracy and use "lost keys" analogy for creative work unpredictability

## Bottom Line
Managers handle business context and external friction you don't see, so treat their requests as valid requirements while communicating your work's nature through visible documentation and concrete analogies they can understand.
