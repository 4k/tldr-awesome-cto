## Key Insights

**Channel Setup:**
- Use Trello board subscriptions for instant progress notifications instead of email - reduces communication lag
- Subscribe to all GitHub repo activities, cancel email notifications, use in-app notifications with marking/muting features
- Apply strict email filters to eliminate irrelevant company-wide messages and error notifications from other teams
- Implement inbox zero methodology: address immediately or snooze to specific time

**Framework: Minimum Viable Tickets**
- Keep minimum number of tickets in each Kanban list (backlog, in progress, etc.)
- Sort tickets by priority within each list
- Link Pull Requests directly to tickets for code visibility
- Use "+1" emojis on ticket updates to show engagement and encourage continued updates

**Draft PRs Strategy:**
- Require team members to open PRs immediately, even incomplete work
- Use GitHub's "Draft PR" feature to reduce developer anxiety about early reviews
- Early PRs prevent conflicts by enabling feedback before significant time investment

**Meeting Optimization:**
- Default to 30-minute meetings, extend if needed rather than booking 1-hour slots
- Require meeting agendas - eliminates vague "discuss X" meetings
- Use "start with emails, escalate to meetings" hierarchy for conflict resolution

**Habit Formation Protocol:**
1. Explain why communication reduces future overhead
2. Set expectation: check channels twice daily minimum
3. Enforce "still in progress" responses rather than silence
4. Use gentle reminders ("did you check Trello recently?") after 4-hour non-response window

## Bottom Line
Replace status meetings with smart notification subscriptions, early draft PRs, and systematic habit formation through gentle enforcement of response expectations.
