## Key Insights

**Manager Rights:**
- Final say on hiring, firing, and leveling decisions (with team input but ultimate authority)
- Guaranteed honest, timely feedback from reports, peers, and leaders
- Tactical, strategic, and emotional support from other managers
- Mandatory self-care and real vacations
- Right to leadership coaching and career development
- Right to step down from management without pressure

**Manager Responsibilities:**
- Recruit, hire, train team; build emotional safety and team cohesion
- Actively redistribute opportunities; resist hiring monoculture
- Support individual career trajectories, work/life balance, team dynamics
- Monitor other teams for unsupported people; collaborate with peers to fix gaps
- Give feedback early/often; receive feedback gracefully; address hard issues with care
- Drive progress by preventing rabbit-holing; ensure redundancy in critical areas
- Own team planning process; be accountable for goals; communicate priorities clearly
- Manage calendar actively; be accessible; contain personal emotions (lean on manager/peers for support)
- Prioritize personal growth and model desired employee behaviors
- Maintain vulnerability

**Framework Structure:**
Rights establish what managers need to succeed; responsibilities define what they owe their teams and organization. Rights enable sustainable management; responsibilities drive team/company outcomes.

## Bottom Line
Effective management requires explicit rights (authority, support, development) paired with clear responsibilities (team care, progress, planning, feedback) to create sustainable leadership that serves both individuals and organizational goals.
