**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**Role Evolution by Team Size:**
- 1 engineer: 90% coding, living in $300/month closet, building MVP
- 2-10 engineers: 60% coding, 30-40% recruiting (this recruiting ratio stays constant throughout all stages)
- 11-50 engineers: Started clinging to coding while trying to manage - failed spectacularly
- 51-100 engineers: 60% people management, 40% recruiting, zero coding except hackathons

**The Binary Choice at ~50 Engineers:**
- Technical co-founders must choose: stay technical and hire VP Engineering, OR give up coding entirely for management
- Attempting both simultaneously causes team instability and personal burnout
- Author's failed NYC trip: planned 3 days reading management books, spent entire time coding instead

**Management Transition Framework:**
- Replace technical books with: Mindset, High Output Management, The Score Takes Care of Itself
- Shift focus from "growing code" to "growing engineering team"
- Satisfaction source changes from personal coding output to team impact over longer time horizons

**Specific Management Activities (51-100 stage):**
- Engineering onboarding improvement
- Performance management systems
- Diversity and inclusion initiatives
- Technical debt balancing processes
- Cross-office code ownership negotiations

**Scale Benchmarks:**
- 60,000 customers, 600 employees, 100 engineers, $1B+ valuation after 6 years

## Bottom Line
CTOs must completely abandon coding around 50 engineers to focus exclusively on people management and recruiting, or risk team instability from trying to do both roles poorly.
