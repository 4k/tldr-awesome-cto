## Key Insights

**Fundamental Mindset Shifts:**
- Employment is selling your labor, not "getting a job" - approach as a market transaction
- Always negotiate - offers are rescinded <1% of time, usually for egregious behavior
- Information asymmetry is your only power - never reveal salary expectations, current comp, or decision timeline

**The 10 Rules (6 covered):**
1. **Get everything in writing** - Document all verbal details immediately
2. **Always keep the door open** - Avoid premature commitments at decision points
3. **Information is power** - Protect what you're thinking/wanting; force them to guess
4. **Always be positive** - Excitement is your most valuable negotiating asset
5. **Don't be the decision-maker** - Reference family/friends to deflect pressure tactics
6. **Have alternatives** - Use any offer to create urgency at other companies

**Tactical Execution:**
- First response to offers: "Sounds great! Talking to other companies, will get back to you"
- Immediately notify all other companies about your offer to accelerate their timelines
- Fight exploding offers (<72hr expiration) by explicitly calling them unreasonable - companies will extend
- Target larger companies early (slower processes), startups later (faster cycles)
- Maximize overlapping offer windows for negotiation leverage

**Company Psychology:**
- Multiple offers create stronger signal than single interviews (weak/noisy data)
- Companies rationally value candidates with other offers as validation
- Different companies value different skill sets - find where you're most valuable

## Bottom Line
Negotiation is information warfare where your only advantage is keeping employers uncertain about what it takes to close you.
