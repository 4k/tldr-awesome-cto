## Key Insights

- **Manager timing rule**: Best engineering managers are never more than 2-3 years removed from hands-on technical work
- **Pendulum career path**: Alternate between IC and management roles instead of picking one track permanently
- **Skills decay principle**: You can only improve at engineering OR management at one time - management kills engineering skills through constant interruptions
- **Tech lead requirement**: Best tech leads have management experience because they understand people/process, not just code
- **Management reality**: It's a lateral career move, not a promotion - you become junior-level in new skills
- **Core conflict**: Great engineering requires focused attention; management requires being interruptible - these are mutually exclusive
- **Business context**: Being an IC is "reverse-engineering how a company works with very little information" - management teaches you how business actually operates
- **Hybrid role instability**: Manager+tech lead combinations decay over time as engineering context gets stale
- **Assignment principle**: Managers must hand off challenging work to engineers to help them grow
- **Misery indicator**: If you don't think you're bad at management when you start, you're not doing the job properly

## Bottom Line
The most effective technical leaders oscillate between individual contributor and management roles every 2-3 years to maintain both technical credibility and people skills.
