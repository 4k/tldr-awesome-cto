## Key Insights

**Market Reality:**
- Only 1 in 100 engineers are unemployed; 50% plan to switch jobs within a year
- 50% of engineers would take less pay for better culture/brand
- 70% of companies make hiring decisions after 3 interview rounds

**Employer Branding (Critical First Step):**
- Hiring is marketing - build brand before sourcing
- Create "What it means to be an engineer at [Company]" content piece
- Document mission, culture, philosophy through engineering blogs
- Examples: Etsy's Code as Craft, Square's The Corner

**Sourcing Channels (Priority Order):**
1. **Referrals**: Lowest cost, highest trust, but risk homogeneity
2. **Hiring Platforms**: Fast but expensive (AngelList, LinkedIn)
3. **Outbound**: High quality but time-intensive
4. **Employer Brand**: Highest reach but requires sustained effort

**Screening Process:**
- Skip technical screening initially - do 30-min relationship building calls first
- Key screening questions:
  - "Why are you taking time to talk today?" (motivation)
  - "What's your proudest achievement?" (excitement factors)
  - "Recent article/repo recommendation?" (industry engagement)

**Interview Approach:**
- Practical over algorithmic: Test actual job skills, not whiteboard algorithms
- Design 2-3 hour projects mirroring real work
- Include collaboration with team member
- Ask candidates to explain decision-making process

**Closing Strategy:**
- Move fast - speed advantage over big tech
- Discuss compensation openly, no vagueness
- Stay responsive via text/immediate communication
- Showcase company passion and story

**Culture Fit Warning:**
- Early companies (1-10 employees): 50% prioritize culture fit most
- Larger companies (50+): Only 37.5% prioritize culture fit most
- Most "culture tests" actually test "Do I like this person?" leading to homogeneous teams

## Bottom Line
Treat engineering hiring as marketing: build authentic employer brand first, prioritize relationship-building over screening, use practical interviews over algorithms, and close with speed and transparency.
