## Key Insights
- Technical debt is borrowing against future development velocity to ship features faster today
- Like financial debt, technical debt has interest payments: slower development, more bugs, harder onboarding
- Key difference: technical debt's "interest rate" is variable and unpredictable, unlike fixed financial debt
- Most teams accumulate technical debt unconsciously without tracking the "loan terms"
- Organizational debt follows same pattern: quick fixes to process/structure that create long-term friction
- Strategic technical debt can be valuable when:
  - You need to test market hypotheses quickly
  - The borrowed time helps you reach next funding milestone
  - The feature enables learning that changes your technical direction
- Track technical debt like financial debt: document what you borrowed, expected payback timeline, actual impact on velocity
- Set explicit "credit limits" - maximum technical debt before mandatory paydown period
- Different types have different interest rates: infrastructure debt compounds faster than UI debt

## Bottom Line
Technical debt becomes a strategic tool when you consciously choose to borrow development time with clear repayment plans, rather than accidentally accumulating it.
