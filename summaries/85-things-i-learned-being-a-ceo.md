## Key Insights

**Decision Making & Strategy**
- Make decisions with 80% information max - speed beats perfection, course-correct later
- For strategic decisions: completely disconnect from operations, clear your mind, think only about future impact
- Wrong decisions 50%+ of the time is normal - detect mistakes early, never repeat them
- Some decisions can "significantly alter company direction" - don't rush these, let serendipity happen

**Cash Management & Fundraising**
- Track 4 metrics monthly: cash outflow, revenue collected, salary spend, bank balance
- Raise money in good times, not when you need it - raise maximum possible amount
- Practice pitch constantly to deliver anywhere, anytime
- Friendly terms > extra money (accept $500K less for better terms)

**People Management Systems**
- Hire HR at 30 employees, formal performance management at 40-50 employees
- Do monthly 1-on-1s with direct reports - non-negotiable
- Set quarterly goals for everyone (main cause of underperformance is lack of direction)
- Interview target: 15 interviews/week for first 2 years
- Require unanimous "Yes" votes for hires (single "No" = don't hire)

**Time & Meeting Management**
- Email management: Use multiple inbox system (HubSpot method)
- 30-minute Sunday calendar review weekly
- Two meeting types only: decision-making or information-gathering
- 1-hour meeting = 30 minutes prep minimum
- Ask for agenda + your expected role before accepting any meeting

**Culture & Leadership**
- Culture requires constant repetition - "speak, shout, repeat, chant, recite and roar"
- Lead by example always - people emulate what you do, not what you say
- Create circle of unshakably loyal people for crisis situations
- Monthly "All Hands" meetings (80%+ attendance for 3 years)

## Bottom Line
CEO success depends on systematic processes for cash tracking, people management, and decision-making speed rather than perfection, while constantly fundraising and protecting company downside.
