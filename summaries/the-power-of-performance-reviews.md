## Key Insights

**Preparation (3-5 hours per direct report):**
- Gather feedback using 3 simple questions: What should they start/continue/stop doing?
- Form your own opinion before collecting peer feedback to avoid bias
- Identify 1-2 development areas max (more than 2 prevents meaningful progress)
- Include specific examples, concrete improvement suggestions, and "killing it" vision
- Define timeline to next level: 6-12 months (typical), 6 months (close to promotion), 12-18 months (just promoted)

**Delivery Framework:**
- Schedule 45 minutes + 30 minutes prep time
- Send document 2-4 hours before meeting for processing time
- Bring printed copies with highlighter
- Share rating first (people can't focus until they know)
- Spend 2/3 of meeting on development area details
- End with compensation updates and action planning

**Follow-up System:**
- Create monthly 1-hour "Career Coaching" meetings (separate from weekly 1:1s)
- Build 5-7 concrete action items in shared spreadsheet with status colors
- Report leads the monthly check-in, manager asks questions vs. giving answers
- Keep running Google Doc of noteworthy instances throughout the year

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Spending less than 3 hours preparing
- Over-relying on peer feedback (high performers often ruffle feathers)
- Including too many development areas
- Having one-sided conversations
- No follow-up structure

**Template Structure:**
- Accomplishments + positive peer quotes
- Superpower identification
- High-level narrative (4-6 sentences)
- Development areas with examples and improvement suggestions

## Bottom Line
Transform performance reviews from dreaded chores into career acceleration tools by spending 3-5 hours preparing structured feedback, limiting focus to 1-2 development areas, and implementing monthly follow-up coaching sessions with concrete action items.
