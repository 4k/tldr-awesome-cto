## Key Insights

**Framework Structure:**
- 4 buckets: Keep the Lights On (KTLO) + 3 elective categories with 60/20/20% target split
- Build new stuff (customer acquisition/upsell): ~60%
- Improve existing stuff (customer satisfaction/retention): ~20% 
- Increase productivity (internal tooling/automation): ~20%
- KTLO defined as "minimum tasks to maintain current service level" - be rigorous to prevent gaming

**KTLO Categories:**
- Security audits, uptime maintenance, customer defect fixes
- Routine procedures, dependency updates (browsers, libraries, platforms)
- On-call duties, monitoring, troubleshooting

**Operational Process:**
- Annual strategic planning: Review previous year's allocation, adjust targets based on company goals
- Quarterly team reviews: Expected vs actual allocation reporting (lightweight, led by engineering directors)
- Initial rollout requires engineering/product leadership offsite for buy-in and clarity

**Key Success Factors:**
- Framework must be MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
- 60/20/20 applies to overall org, not individual teams
- Perfect accounting is non-goal - "good enough" works
- Communicate beyond engineering to all partner organizations
- KTLO% varies by company but should be consistent within organization

**Observed Benefits:**
- Forced clarity on project goals and KPI selection
- Reduced interdepartmental tension and politics
- Better director-level alignment on resource allocation
- Simple existence of framework drove 95% of desired behavior changes

## Bottom Line
A simple 4-bucket resource allocation framework (KTLO + 60/20/20 elective split) with quarterly reporting creates organizational alignment and reduces engineering-business conflicts without heavy process overhead.
