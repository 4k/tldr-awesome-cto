## Key Insights

**When You Don't Know the Answer:**
- Pattern: (1) Admit uncertainty, (2) Own the follow-up, (3) Give specific timeline, (4) Deliver concise response
- Example responses: "I don't know, but I can investigate and get back to you after lunch" or "I'll ask [name] and get back to you by end of day"
- Smart people don't know everything—they know where to find answers

**Managing Problems/Outages:**
- Always control the message—ensure leadership learns problems from you, not customers
- Pattern: (1) Establish yourself as owner working on solution, (2) Share known steps or commit to update timeline, (3) Give specific timelines for fixes or next updates
- Never say just "We're working on it"—always include when you'll provide next update
- Proactive communication prevents negative amplification during radio silence

**Disagreeing with Leadership:**
- Pattern: (1) Remove emotion (wait 1-2 days if needed), (2) Ask about context/reasons instead of disagreeing, (3) Start with direct manager before escalating, (4) Research and present alternatives achieving same goals, (5) Support the final decision and explain reasoning to your team
- Don't tell team "because [boss] made me do it"—explain the strategic reasoning
- Your job is company success, not 100% agreement with leadership

**Receiving Negative Feedback:**
- Single response pattern: "I hear you. I will be more mindful of that in the future."
- Focus on breathing, heart rate, relaxed face during delivery
- If emotional, leave immediately and follow up via email after collecting thoughts
- Feedback is opportunity to strengthen manager relationship when handled well

## Bottom Line
Pre-planned response patterns for high-stakes workplace situations prevent emotional reactions and position you as a problem-solving leader rather than someone making excuses.
