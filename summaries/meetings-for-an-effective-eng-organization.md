## Key Insights

**Core Meeting Structure:**
- 6 essential meetings: 3 operational (weekly team, tech spec review, incident review), 2 developmental (staff engineers monthly, eng managers monthly), 1 communication (monthly eng Q&A)
- Weekly team meetings should include cross-functional partners (recruiting, people, finance) to resolve issues immediately vs backlogging
- Tech spec/incident reviews fail when they become presentations; succeed when anchored in audience feedback and discussion
- Require reading documents before reviews - block 30 minutes on calendars for pre-reading

**Scaling Guidelines:**
- <20 engineers: only need weekly team meeting
- Scale operational meetings for right participants (split mobile reviews if audience lacks mobile context)
- Scale developmental meetings for engagement (max 10 people or participation drops)
- Split meetings for bad actors is wrong approach - hold individuals accountable instead

**Q&A Meeting Mechanics:**
- Use voting tools for question prioritization, support anonymous questions
- Start with "no questions off limits" disclaimer
- Highlight individual contributors when answering relevant questions
- Alternate time slots across time zones vs increasing frequency
- Don't record Q&As (reduces question quality)

**Execution Details:**
- Maintain running agendas in group-editable documents
- Find dedicated owners for spec/incident reviews (high-impact leadership opportunities)
- 1:1 cadence: weekly with directs, weekly with 3 closest exec peers, monthly with other peers
- Skip-levels: allocate fixed 1-2 hours/week, adjust format to stay within budget

## Bottom Line
Meetings are backup communication solutions that become essential at scale - focus on 6 core types with specific formats and ruthlessly optimize for participant engagement over convenience.
