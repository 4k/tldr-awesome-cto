## Key Insights

**ESOP Size & Benchmarks:**
- US late-stage startups: employees own ~20% vs 10% in Europe
- European ownership ranges 4-20% (inconsistent), US more standardized at market-driven levels
- Recommended ESOP sizes: 10-20% at seed, 12% Series A, 14% Series B, 16% Series C
- European startups "flat line" ESOPs at 10% while US grows to 20-25% by Series D

**Grant Allocation Framework:**
- Seed stage: Senior engineers 1.0%, mid-level 0.45%, junior 0.15% of FDE
- Series A executives: C-suite 0.8-1.5%, VPs 0.3-0.8% of FDE  
- Staff grants: Calculate as % of base salary (Engineering directors 75%, seniors 50%, individuals 33%)
- Use 9-box performance matrix: Rate performance + potential on 3-point scale to determine multipliers

**Vesting & Retention:**
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff, monthly after cliff
- Consider back-loaded vesting (10%-20%-30%-40%) vs linear (25% yearly) for better retention
- Only 4-5 of first 20 employees typically stay through IPO
- Extended exercise periods (90 days standard, consider 1 year per year of tenure)

**Critical Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Full acceleration vesting for all employees (kills acquisitions)
- European-style bad leaver provisions (too punitive)
- High strike prices when low FMV available
- Vague equity promises without formal documentation

**Specific Numbers:**
- At $1B exit: 1% equity = $10M gross (before dilution/tax)
- Typical Series A team: 50 new hires below executive level
- All-employee schemes: 75% adoption in Bay Area vs 32% continental Europe

## Bottom Line
European startups systematically under-allocate equity compared to US counterparts, losing talent competition and limiting scale potential—aim for 12-16% ESOPs with performance-driven grants using salary-based calculations rather than ad-hoc percentage allocations.
