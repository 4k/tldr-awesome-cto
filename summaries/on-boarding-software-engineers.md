## Key Insights

**Program Results:**
- 55 engineers onboarded over 22 months with only 1 churning within 3 months
- 80% retention rate at 2.5 years for Sept 2016-March 2017 cohort
- 100% positive/neutral feedback on first month experience
- 70% of feedback sessions yielded actionable improvements
- New engineers became mentors within 3.5 months average

**Core Framework:**
- Engineers own engineer onboarding (not HR)
- Designated "Onboarding Champions" standardize process across teams
- Pre-start communication begins at contract signing (reduces pre-start churn)
- Mandatory buddy training sessions held week before newcomer starts
- Tailored onboarding plans based on individual learning styles and experience

**Implementation Tactics:**
- Day 1 team lunch is non-negotiable
- Create "circle of friendly faces" beyond just the buddy
- Act as "cultural interpreter" for company acronyms/customs
- Multi-week gradual learning curve prevents information overload
- Pet projects balance learning efficiency with practical application
- Wiki system captures institutional knowledge from all past onboardings

**Feedback Loop:**
- Post-onboarding feedback sessions without managers present
- Newcomers update documentation to help future hires
- Mentorship treated as career growth milestone and "rite of passage"

**Key Principle:** 
Primary KPI is time until newcomer refers to company as "we" instead of "you"

## Bottom Line
Engineer-owned onboarding with dedicated champions, tailored learning plans, and systematic knowledge retention achieves 98% three-month retention while building mentorship culture.
