## Key Insights

• Hiring managers have the highest impact on new employee success because they best understand required skills, resources, and connections needed for effectiveness

• Create a structured 90-day onboarding plan with specific milestones and check-ins rather than ad-hoc introductions

• Assign a peer buddy (not just HR contact) who can answer practical day-to-day questions about systems, culture, and unwritten rules

• Schedule early wins - identify 2-3 small projects the new hire can complete in first 30 days to build confidence and credibility

• Introduce new hires to key stakeholders systematically with context about each relationship's importance to their role

• Set up weekly 1:1s immediately to provide feedback loops and course-correct before problems compound

• Document institutional knowledge and processes instead of relying on verbal knowledge transfer that gets forgotten

## Bottom Line

Hiring managers who create structured onboarding with early wins, peer support, and systematic stakeholder introductions dramatically increase new hire retention and time-to-productivity.
