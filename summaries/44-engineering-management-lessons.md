## Key Insights

**Core Responsibilities**
- Act as information hub knowing what every engineer works on; connect dots that wouldn't otherwise connect
- Be tiebreaker when teams can't reach consensus, but don't make decisions unless necessary
- Enforce behavioral/performance standards: fire bullies and underperformers
- Stop coding features/fixing bugs - write code only to remain effective tiebreaker

**Decision Framework**
- When tiebreaking: Wait for all opinions, summarize all viewpoints clearly, list points of agreement, state what you learned, then decide
- Enforce decisions once made; don't let teams waste time in circles
- Reopen only with significant new information

**Conflict Resolution Process**
- Most conflict stems from people not feeling heard
- Sit with each person, ask how they feel, listen, ask again, summarize back to them
- Use non-violent communication for critiquing behavior without offense

**Performance Management**
- Evaluate monthly/quarterly, not daily
- If consistently wondering if someone's a good fit "for too long" - fire them
- Don't invent excuses to avoid firing; it's harder than it should be

**Authority Building**
- Authority earned through good decisions over time, not bestowed
- When people push boundaries, firm "I'm not ok with that" usually sufficient
- Show rough edge when pushed too far or lose team authority
- If saying "I'm not ok with that" repeatedly to same person - time to fire

**Emotional Intelligence**
- Most intellectual arguments have strong emotional undercurrents - identify them first
- Trust feelings when something seems wrong; don't let others bully you into ignoring intuition
- 95% of blame situations resolve through conversation

## Bottom Line
Engineering management is about being an information hub who makes tough decisions when needed while building authority through consistent good judgment and difficult conversations.
