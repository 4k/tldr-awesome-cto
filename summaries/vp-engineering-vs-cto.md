**Section:** CTO Position

---

## Key Insights

**Role Definitions:**
- VP Engineering: Manager/team builder focused on recruiting, communication, issue resolution. Makes engineering team successful day-to-day
- CTO: Strongest technologist - architect, researcher, tester. Ensures technical approach is correct
- Key dynamic: "CTO makes sure technical approach is correct, VP Engineering makes sure the team is correct. They are yin and yang"

**Organizational Evolution:**
- Early stage: Technical co-founder wears both hats
- Split typically happens around 20 people
- Most technical co-founders migrate to CTO role, then hire VP Engineering
- Reverse (co-founder becomes VP Eng, hires CTO) less common but works

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Requires different personality traits that rarely coexist in one person
- Different time allocations - both are full-time jobs
- Must have mutual trust, respect, and liking between roles
- CTO often plays key role in strategic customer wins and sales assists

**Failure Modes:**
- Person trying to do both roles: ineffective at both, defaults to VP Eng, or consciously chooses VP Eng
- Early stage companies make more progress with VP Eng than CTO alone
- CTOs without VP Eng spend too much time designing perfection vs. shipping first version

**Additional CTO Responsibilities:**
- Customer-facing presentations to C-suite prospects
- Product roadmap collaboration (2-5 year vision)
- Technical sales support for large deals

## Bottom Line
Most companies need both roles by 20 people, with CTO focused on technical vision/architecture and VP Engineering on team execution - finding someone who excels at both is extremely rare.
