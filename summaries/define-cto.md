## Key Insights

**CTO Role Evolution:**
- CTO roles aren't standardized - only 1 of 20 CTOs surveyed was chief architect; most are "facilitators of the technology organization"
- Being part-time chief architect is harder than part-time head of product because infrastructure quality only emerges through extensive building
- Four mechanisms to understand organizational problems: doing work, talking to people, observing work, planning work

**VP Engineering Partnership:**
- When hiring VP Eng externally, had all 25 engineers do 1:1s with candidate over 4 days to test for core skill needed
- Two delegation approaches work: complete delegation or full involvement in details - "sparse micromanagement" is worst option
- Communication pattern: 2 weekly 1:1s plus "I plan to do X; will execute in 24hrs unless objected"

**Organizational Scaling:**
- At Dunbar's number (~150 people), shift from "close friends" to formal processes required
- Feedback loops break when transitioning responsibilities - anecdotes become outdated quickly
- Energy management > time management for executives

**Technical Leadership Structure:**
- Created "architecture working group" - engineers available to help others build better systems
- Prototype-and-dump doesn't work; partnering with team engineers on prototypes is better
- Getting back to coding provides better organizational perspective than pure management

## Bottom Line
CTOs should focus on energy management over time management, maintain tight communication loops with VP Engineering partners, and find ways to stay connected to actual work rather than purely managing.
