# Awesome CTO — Distilled

> 153 articles from [awesome-cto](https://github.com/kuchin/awesome-cto), fetched, read by AI, and ruthlessly compressed into pure signal. No fluff, no intros, no "in today's fast-paced world..." — just the insights that matter.

## What is this?

The [awesome-cto](https://github.com/kuchin/awesome-cto) repo (32k+ ⭐) is a legendary collection of articles for CTOs and engineering leaders. The problem? Nobody has time to read them all.

This repo solves that. Every (still existing) article was:

1. **Fetched** — scraped and converted to clean text
2. **Distilled** — summarized by AI (Claude, Anthropic) with a single directive: _extract only actionable insights, concrete frameworks, specific numbers, and non-obvious lessons. Kill everything else._
3. **Organized** — grouped by topic, linked back to originals

The result is a browsable knowledge base you can read in an afternoon instead of a month.

📖 **[Read everything in one file →](summaries/ALL_SUMMARIES.md)**

## How This Was Made

A Python script using:
- **[trafilatura](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura)** for article extraction (best-in-class boilerplate removal)
- **[Anthropic Message Batches API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)** for parallel summarization with Claude
- A system prompt tuned for distillation — no summaries, just signal
