My top 25 items in a senior engineer’s checklist

This is a simple checklist, and while it is useful to any software engineer, it is especially useful to senior engineers. More items from the list can be found here.
- Understand the business aspect of your work, and what makes money. Eventually, only that matters.
- Get involved with hiring for your team and company, and maintain a high bar for hiring quality candidates.
- Design and develop systems appropriate to scale, extensibility, and scope of the problem. Avoid over-engineering.
- Question everything and ask “why” repetitively until you get to the root of problems and situations.
- Demand accountability and ownership from others.
- Lead at least one major project with a clear definition and target of successful delivery.
- Work towards disambiguating ambiguous problem statements.
- Work on increasing your influence on other teams.
- Do not be adamant about your views. Listen to others and accept that there is more than one way to look at a problem statement, and multiple valid solutions to a problem.
- Be involved with multiple projects as a consultant, a reviewer and/or a mentor.
- Follow the principles of extreme ownership.
- Have strong mentors to help you navigate and grow in the company.
- Take projects with high risk and high rewards.
- Strive for deep technical expertise in technologies used in your team.
- Ask for stretch projects from your manager, or help her identify one for you.
- Discuss the goals of your manager, and how you align your work with it.
- Invest time in networking effectively with seniors, peers, and juniors.
- Be a mentor to a couple of junior engineers.
- Increase your breadth of knowledge in the domain of your team/company.
- Drive your one-on-ones. Maintain a list of topics for the next one-on-one discussion.
- Discuss problems with your manager, but have some solutions beforehand.
- Increase your breadth of knowledge in technology.
- Explore emerging technologies by building small prototypes.
- Read a few technical books every year.
- Before suggesting the next big shiny technology for your production stack, understand its pros and cons thoroughly.
