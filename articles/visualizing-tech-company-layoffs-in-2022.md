Visualizing Tech Company Layoffs in 2022
Layoffs are happening so frequently in 2022 that everyone from Crunchbase to Indian tech website Inc42 are now keeping track.
There is even a standalone website tracking all tech layoffs in the United States.
For the purposes of this infographic, we’ve used data from trueup.io which includes a mix of U.S. and international tech companies that have let workers go in 2022.
A Thousand Cuts: Mass Layoffs by Tech Companies
Layoffs are having an impact on the entire tech industry, and the phenomenon is global. Here are some of the most high-profile examples of mass layoffs in 2022:
Meta: The social media giant faces competition from upstarts like TikTok, as well as a pool of ad dollars that is shrinking in the face of a faltering economy. Although this reduction in headcount is painful for Meta, it’s worth considering a more broad perspective. In close to two decades of doing business, these will be the company’s first wide-scale job cuts.
Twitter: Though Meta wins with sheer volume of cuts, Twitter’s mass layoffs are surely the most dramatic. In early November, the company’s iconoclastic new owner, Elon Musk, slashed 50% of the workforce, and soon after, thousands of contractors also suddenly lost their jobs. Estimating how many employees remain at the company will remain a challenge until the dust settles.
Byju’s: Layoffs are not just confined to the United States. India’s sizable tech sector is also facing cuts. EdTech giant, Byju’s, laid off 2,500 employees in October—around 5% of its total workforce.
Peloton: The high-end workout equipment company has been dropping its headcount throughout the year. In the visualization above, companies like Meta stand out as they eliminated thousands of employees all at once. Peloton, however, executed its layoffs in stages throughout the year. After strong growth during the pandemic began to stagnate, the company is slimming down to regain profitability.
Why are Tech Companies Laying Off so Many People?
The stated reasons for letting so many workers go are economic uncertainty (external factors) and poor performance (internal factors).
Goldman Sachs Research points out that “higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions disproportionately impact the sector because tech company profits are typically expected further out in the future and therefore subject to greater duration risk.”
Shrinking advertising budgets and the implosion of the cryptocurrency market are also factors that may have influenced the decision to cut headcounts. Twitter and Snapchat fall into the former bucket, while Coinbase and Kraken fall into the latter.
What Do These Job Cuts Mean for the Economy?
At face value, widespread layoffs in the tech sector might appear to be a bad omen for the wider economy—especially given the outsize influence tech companies have on the markets.
Thankfully, this does not appear to be the case. Payroll and wage data from the U.S. government have exceeded expectations, and the country’s unemployment rate is close to a half-century low.
So, why the disconnect?
First off, tech jobs only account for less than 3% of total employment in America. As well, tech workers who’ve lost their jobs have a high likelihood of securing a new job in short order.
It remains to be seen whether November will be the peak of job cuts. Employers generally try to avoid letting people go right before the holiday season. One week into December, Trueup.io has tracked 7,600 more layoffs.

Numbeo’s dataset is primarily crowdsourced, drawing on user-submitted cost-of-living information from cities around the world.
North America Tops the Rankings
U.S. cities dominate the top end of the ranking. New York leads by a wide margin, with average monthly rent exceeding $8,300.
Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles also rank among the world’s most expensive cities, reflecting strong demand, limited housing supply, and high-income labor markets.

January 5, 2026Where Housing Inventory is Rising in U.S. Cities
See visuals like this from many other data creators on our Voronoi app. Download it for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.
Key Takeaways
- U.S. housing inventory rose 26% year-over-year in July 2025, reaching its highest level since at least 2017.
- Sun Belt and fast-growing metro areas saw the sharpest increases in homes for sale.
After years of historically tight housing supply, inventory levels across the U.S. are rebounding. More homes are coming onto the market, giving buyers greater choice and easing some of the pressure that defined the post-pandemic housing boom. This map highlights how housing inventory changed across major U.S. cities in July 2025 compared to a year earlier.
The data for this visualization comes from Homes.com.
Sun Belt Cities Lead the Inventory Surge
Several fast-growing Sun Belt metros top the list for inventory growth. Raleigh, North Carolina, saw the largest increase, with listings up 54.5% year over year.

| 40 | Chicago, IL | 6.7% |
Las Vegas, Miami, and Atlanta also posted gains above 35%, reflecting a rapid cooling from earlier housing booms.
Large Coastal Markets See Meaningful Gains
Major coastal cities are also seeing notable increases in housing inventory. San Diego’s listings rose 32.4%, while Los Angeles posted a 23.1% increase. Seattle, Sacramento, and Portland all saw gains near or above the national average.
Although inventory is rising, affordability challenges remain acute in these markets. Higher mortgage rates and elevated home prices continue to limit buyer activity.
In contrast, several Midwestern and Northeastern cities recorded more modest inventory growth. Chicago’s listings increased just 6.7%, while Minneapolis and San Jose saw gains below 10%. New York City’s inventory rose 17.6%, well below the national average.
