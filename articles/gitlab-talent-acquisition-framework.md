Hiring & Talent Acquisition Handbook
At the core of our team’s vision, mission, and strategy is our ability to impact GitLab’s overarching mission: to make it so that everyone can contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. When everyone can contribute, users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation.
As a Talent Acquisition team, we have an outsized impact on GitLab’s ability to make this mission a reality, by connecting top talent to profound careers from wherever they are in a truly distributed, remote workforce.
Talent Acquisition Mission Statement
Through exceptional partnership and experiences, we attract and hire results-driven talent to build high-performing distributed teams that accelerate GitLab’s growth.
Our Guiding Principles
As we set out to achieve this mission, we will continue to rely on core guiding principles to define how we build toward the future.
- Experience: Stakeholder experience is central to our craft. We are a partner, an advisor, and an essential component to building high performing teams and culture at GitLab.
- Inclusivity: We design fair and equitable processes into the fabric of what we do. We believe Talent Acquisition has an outsized impact on the make-up of our teams, and we strive to continue to build them with inclusivity as a integral piece of our craft.
- Predictability: Our ability to have the right team members, in the right roles, at the right time is imperative to execute on our objectives as an organization. We strive for predictability: to build accuracy in our forecasts and enable the business to look around corners through strong relationships and data driven decision making.
Our Objectives and Roadmap
We strive to be as transparent as possible, but these sections are only available for our GitLab team members.
