What does a high performing team look like?
Before we talk about the how, let me share with you what I believe a high performing team looks like. Taking from my experience coaching Series A through D CEOs and execs, as well as my time managing a team of stellar Mochary Method coaches, I was able to synthesize these commonalities.
They are aligned with and motivated by the company vision and culture
High performers deeply resonate with the vision of the company. They are proactive in aligning their personal vision with the company vision to create win-win scenarios.
They embody similar values as the company culture. For example, many companies we coach (and our own) have a cultural norm of transparent and immediate feedback. The high performers in these environments truly believe feedback is a gift; they are active in giving and receiving.
They execute quickly
They are comfortable navigating ambiguity. They feel secure to iterate, fail and learn rapidly. They take an idea and run towards completion with accountability.
They leverage their Zone of Genius
They have awareness around what their ZoG is and spend the majority of the time working in them. They also understand their weaknesses, and are proactive in outsourcing, delegating or making it awesome.
They bring solutions with an owner mindset
They think of problems with a framework akin to Issue Proposed Solution, where they present you with solutions to get feedback. They state their intention and explain why instead of asking for permission (see Turn the Ship Around: “I intend to …”).
They lift each other up and strive for positive sum
High performers enjoy working with other high performers. They raise the bar constantly. They are eager to help their teammates and understand that we win together.
They master the balance of asking for help and figuring it out
High performers don’t wait too long to ask for help. When they do, they clearly state their request and the work they’ve done already in tackling this problem.
If you resonate with the above, the following steps will make your high performing team a reality at your company.
Step 1: Hire and Fire Well
In order to create high performing teams, you have to hire and fire well. We have a full process on Recruiting. I will include some other battle-tested tools that help with the hiring process.
New hire and manager’s 30-60-90
Anti-sell
Fire well
Part 2: Create Trust
Trust is created with clarity, care, transparenc,y and consistency. Trust is the prerequisite to feedback. Feedback is the prerequisite to high performance.
So, how do we create trust?
On day 1, achieve clarity with three components:
Working agreements
What excellence looks like
Reiteration of 30-60-90
Show your care by actively listening and remembering what is important to their professional and personal life.
Run Magic Questions with your direct reports monthly
Ask for your direct report’s 5-year professional dream. Document it in your 1:1 doc and discuss progress against it at least every quarter
Practice transparency by giving clear, unbiased and challenging absolute feedback monthly at the very least.
You can refer to my Performance Review write-up to learn how to create a system of direct feedback.
Last but not least, lead with clarity, care and transparency consistently. Identify the tools that make the biggest impact to your people, then assign an internal DRI to create reminders and repetitions of these tools.
I know two types of CEOs. One type will read the above and think “Wow, that’s way too much work.” The other type will be excited by the opportunity to deepen trust with their team.
For the first type, know that you can delegate some of these responsibilities to a COO, CoS, or VP of HR. Someone at the organization who is an excellent manager and loves doing this work. I would highly suggest not to outsource giving direct feedback and remembering personal info of your direct reports.
For the second type, have fun!
Part 3: Ongoing Development
Onboarding typically ends at 90 days, but high performers crave ongoing challenge and development. I will include a list of tools that are most popular with Mochary Method CEOs and the internal team:
Clear alignment
Training and Teaching
Accountability and verification
Coach and challenge
Summary
Here’s how you can create a high performing leadership team:
Hire and fire well. Ruthlessly screen for culture fit. Prepare in advance what success looks like to you and the new hire. Let go of employees who are not high-performers.
Create trust with clarity, care, transparency and, consistency.
High performers will need ongoing development. If new hires don’t meet the bar, have clear talent density requirements to let under-performers go gracefully.
It takes a lot to hire, motivate and train high performers. But it will be one of the most worthwhile investments you can make.

Gratitude
Thank you to the Mochary Method coaching team for giving me great feedback on this write-up. Moreover, you gave me the opportunity to test many of these tools and provide real evidence of what a high performing team looks like. Of course, Matt created these detailed write-ups in the curriculum that gave us a foundation to coach CEOs and experiment with our own team.
Special thanks to Regina Gerbeaux (@_rpgbx) for teaching me about managers’ 30-60-90s, and embodying what a manager is like for a high performing team.
