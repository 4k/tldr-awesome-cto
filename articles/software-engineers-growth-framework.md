---

In these days ProntoPro renewed the Growth framework for Software Engineers. If you are wondering what a Growth framework is, well, you can think of it as a tool - hence the word "framework" - that helps employees to progress in their career within the company - hence the word "growth". It is also referred to as "career path", or "career ladder", or "competency matrix".
The reason why we decided to setup a new framework is because our needs changed over time and we realized that the old framework was no longer a fit to us. In particular:
- We scaled up from 5 Engineers to 20+ Engineers in the last 4 years
- We moved from functional silos teams to cross-functional teams
- We gradually stopped focusing on quantitative KPIs - such as velocity - in favor of qualitative KPIs - such as impact
Why is a Growth framework important?
We believe that a Growth framework should provide a solid answer to the following questions:
- How am I performing?
- What areas do I need to focus on to get even better at my current job?
- What future opportunities are available to me?
- How do I need to grow to reach my career goals?
- How does my company ensure a calibrated compensation plan?
- How does my company make sure to hire the right people and onboard them properly?
We tried to keep those questions in mind the entire time while writing down the new framework.
On giants’ shoulders
At the moment of its creation, the new framework was inspired by the following companies and tailored to our current structure and foreseeable future growth needs: Artsy, Basecamp, Buffer, CircleCI, Etsy, Fog Creek, Foursquare, Kickstarter, LeadDev, Looper Insights, Medium, Meetup, Notion, Rent the Runway, Soundcloud, Spotify, Square, Travis, Urban Airship.
If you are wondering why we could not just copy and paste the Growth framework of one of those well-known companies, the reason is that the framework must address the very needs of the company and you surely know how those needs might differ from one company to another. If you are curious about this topic I suggest you to listen to this podcast featuring Tim Olshansky, at the time of writing EVP of Product & Engineering at Zenput.
The framework
Heads-up: this version of the framework is now out-of-date. If you are interested in the latest version of it, please check our handbook.
Tracks, levels, and roles
The career path is organized into two tracks
: the Individual Contributor track and the Manager track.
Each track is made of five levels
.
A role
is the intersection of a given track with a given level.
Individual Contributor track
- Junior Software Engineer
- Software Engineer
- Senior Software Engineer
- Principal Software Engineer
- Chapter Lead
Manager track
- Junior Software Engineer
- Software Engineer
- Senior Software Engineer
- Staff Software Engineer
- Engineering Manager
KPIs
All roles share the same five KPIs
, no matter the track or the level:
- Product
- Technology
- People
- Process
- Area of impact
Each KPI has five steps, describing the level of expectations for that KPI.
Each career level has distinct expectations in terms of KPIs. Those expectations are represented by a given step. The higher the step number, the bigger the expectations related to it. The Senior Software Engineer, for example, is expected to be at least at the second step of the Technology KPI: specialize.
The same concept applies to tracks. Staff Software Engineers and Principal Software Engineers, for example, are on two distinct career tracks. Yet, they share the same KPIs with different expectations.
We believe that sharing the same KPIs across career levels and tracks ensures consistency, simplicity, and flexibility to the framework. It is easy, indeed, to move up the career levels or even switch from one track to another. Also, it gives us a clear and complete picture of our performance, no matter the role we cover.

Evaluation
1. Does not meet expectations
The requirements of the KPI step expected for a given role are not fulfilled.
2. Meets some expectations
Some of the requirements of the KPI step expected for a given role are fulfilled.
3. Exceeds some expectations
All requirements of the KPI step expected for a given role are fulfilled and some of them are exceeded.
4. Exceeds most expectations
Most of the requirements of the KPI step expected for a given role are exceeded.
Promotions
In ProntoPro promotions are descriptive, not prescriptive: we promote Engineers when they have fully demonstrated that they are performing at the next level. Promotions do not unlock new responsibilities; the new responsibilities and increased scope come first and then we recognize it with a promotion.
In particular, in order to get a promotion to a new career level, an Engineer should demonstrate a conscious, comfortable, continuous, consistent competency in the next career level, defined as follows:
- Conscious: Having devoted intentional effort to the endeavor,
- Comfortable: without being overly stretched,
- Continuous: for a reasonable period of time,
- Consistent: reliably and evenly,
- Competency: meeting all the next level criteria.
The examples listed in every KPI step are provided to help give a sense of what type of behaviors we would expect from someone at that step. The examples are not specific criteria that must be met; instead, they help paint a picture of what type of things someone might do when they have achieved that step. You can exhibit different behaviors and achieve different tasks of similar complexity, scale, or impact, and still achieve a step.
Conclusions
The new framework will be effective in ProntoPro starting from March 2021 and we are definitely looking forward to using it and improving it over time.
